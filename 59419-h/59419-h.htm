<h2 id="ON_THE_TYPICAL_LAURENTIAN_AREA">ON THE TYPICAL LAURENTIAN AREA
OF CANADA.</h2>
</div>

<p>The name Laurentian was given by Logan in 1854 to the
great series of rocks forming the Laurentides or Laurentian
Mountains, a district of mountainous country rising to the north
of the River and Gulf of St. Lawrence, and extending in an
unbroken stretch along the shore of the latter from Quebec to
Labrador, a distance of nine hundred miles. This district, with
its continuation to the west as far as Lake Huron, being situated
in the Province of Quebec and the adjacent portion of the Province
of Ontario, and forming part of the main Protaxis of the
continent, is the “Original Laurentian Area” of Logan. The
Laurentian rocks are now known to extend far beyond the limits
of this area to the west and north, constituting, as they do, by
far the greater part of the Protaxis, and underlying (with subordinate
patches of Huronian) an area of somewhat over two million
square miles.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The area above referred to is, however, the one
which was first studied and described; it is the “Typical Laurentian
area,” and to it the observations in the present paper will be
as far as possible confined.</p>

<p>A general exploration of the area in question, and a more
detailed study of a small part of it—the Grenville District—situated
in the counties of Argenteuil and Terrebonne in the Province<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
of Quebec, was carried out by Logan and his assistants in
the early years of the Canadian Geological Survey. An excellent
résumé of the results of these studies is given in the
“Geology of Canada,” published in 1863, which contains not
only a good description of the general petrographical character
and arrangement of the rocks which make up the area, but is
accompanied by an atlas containing two maps illustrating this
description, one showing the general distribution of the Laurentian
in the eastern part of the Dominion, and the other its stratigraphical
relations in the smaller area above referred to.</p>

<p>As a result of these studies, Logan announced his belief that
the Laurentian System consisted of two great unconformable
series of sedimentary rocks, to which he gave the names Upper
and Lower Laurentian. The latter he considered to be divisible
into a lower and an upper portion, which sub-divisions he
regarded as probably conformable to one another. In the course
of time these several series came to be known as the Anorthosite
or Norian Series, the Grenville Series and the Fundamental or
Ottawa Gneiss. Logan’s views may then be represented as
follows:</p>

<table summary="Logan’s views">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl rpad">Anorthosite or Norian Series,</td>
    <td class="tdl">Upper Laurentian.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl rpad">Grenville Series,</td>
    <td class="tdl">Upper portion</td>
    <td class="tdc dbl" rowspan="2">}</td>
    <td class="tdc" rowspan="2">Lower<br />Laurentian.</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl rpad">Fundamental or Ottawa Gneiss,</td>
    <td class="tdl">Lower portion</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Subsequently, in the southeastern corner of the Province of
Ontario, in the district lying to the north of the eastern end of
Lake Ontario, another series of rocks was discovered—the so-called
Hastings Series. Logan supposed this to come in above
the Grenville Series, while Vennor, who subsequently examined
the district, believed it to be equivalent to the lower part of the
Grenville Series already mentioned.</p>

<p>When these investigations were carried out, the microscope had
not as yet been seriously employed in petrographical work. The
precise composition of many of the rocks making up the several
series was not recognized, the effects produced by great dynamic
action were not duly considered, and the foliation possessed in a
high degree by some and to a certain extent by almost all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
rocks was considered, in all cases, to be a more or less obliterated
survival of original bedding. The detailed mapping in the field,
accompanied by microscopical work in the laboratory, by which
alone conclusive results can be obtained in working out the
structure of complicated areas of crystalline schists, was not carried
out, in fact in many districts the construction of detailed
maps was at that time practically impossible. It is not surprising
therefore that, although excellent in the main, some of the
results arrived at have since proved to be erroneous.</p>

<p>It is proposed, in the present paper, to place before the readers
of this <span class="smcap">Journal</span> in as brief a manner as possible, a general
account of the several series of rocks occurring in this area, and
to point out what, in the opinion of the present writer, seems to
have been satisfactorily established concerning the stratigraphical
position and mutual relations of these ancient rocks and what
still remains to be determined by further study, and in conclusion
to give a short sketch of the evolution of this portion of the
continent.</p>

<p><i>The Fundamental Gneiss.</i>—Exposed over very wide stretches
of country in Canada, and making up in all probability by far the
larger part of the Archean Protaxis, is the “Fundamental
Gneiss,” sometimes called, from its great development about
the upper waters of the Ottawa River, the “Ottawa Gneiss.” It
is composed essentially of orthoclase gneiss, usually reddish or
greyish in color. Of this there are a number of varieties, differing
from one another in size of grain, relative proportion of
constituent minerals and in the distinctness of the foliation or
banding. It is sometimes rich in quartz, while at other times
this mineral is present in but very small amount. It is usually
poor in mica and bisilicates. Dark bands of amphibolite are not
uncommon, while basic hornblende or pyroxene gneisses occur
in some places. Other schistose rocks are rarely found. Over
great areas it is often nearly uniform in character and possesses
a foliation which can only be recognized when exposures of considerable
size are examined. On this account it is often referred
to as a granitoid gneiss, a designation, however, which by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
means accurately describes it as a whole. At a locality cited by
Sir William Logan, as one where it is typically developed, namely,
Trembling Mountain in the above mentioned Grenville Area, it
consists of a fine grained reddish orthoclase gneiss, with distinct
but not very decided foliation, containing here and there bands
of orthoclase gneiss of somewhat different character, as well as
bands or layers of a dark amphibolite.</p>

<p>How much of this Fundamental Gneiss really consists
of eruptive material is not known. The indistinct foliation,
in many cases at any rate, is not a survival of original
bedding, but is clearly due to movements in a plastic mass. It
is often possible to recognize the existence of an indistinctly
foliated gneiss intruded into more distinctly foliated gneiss. The
gneiss, in some cases, shows excellently well-marked cataclastic
structure, while in other cases this is not distinct. The evidence
accumulated goes to show that the Fundamental Gneiss consists
of a complicated series of rocks of unknown origin, but comprising
a considerable amount of material of intrusive character.</p>

<p><i>The Grenville Series.</i>—In certain parts of the Laurentian area,
and notably in the Grenville district before mentioned, the Laurentian
has a decidedly different petrographical development.
Orthoclase gneiss is still the predominating rock, but it presents
a much greater variety in mineralogical composition, and is much
more frequently well foliated, often occurring in well defined
bands or layers like the strata of later formations.</p>

<p>Amphibolites are abundant, also hornblende schists, heavy
beds of quartzite and numerous thick bands of crystalline limestone
or marble, all these rocks being interbanded or interstratified
with one another. In the vicinity of the limestones the
variety in petrographical character is especially noticeable; garnets
often occur abundantly in the gneiss, the quartzite and the hornblende
schist, as well as in the limestone itself, beds of pure
garnet rock being found in places. Pyroxene, wollastonite and
other minerals are also abundant, while the presence of graphite
disseminated through the limestones and their associated rocks,
often in such abundance as to give rise to deposits of economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
value, is of especial significance. This mineral which is not
found in the Fundamental Gneiss, occurs usually in little disseminated
scales but occasionally in veins. The limestones are
thoroughly crystalline, generally somewhat coarse in grain and
often nearly pure. They usually, however, contain grains of
serpentine, pyroxene, mica, graphite or other minerals, of which
over fifty species have been noted. They are often interstratified
in thin bands with the gneiss, in places are very impure, and
may be traced for great distances along the strike, being
apparently as continuous as any other element of the series.
This development of the Laurentian is known as the Grenville
Series, and has been considered by all observers to be above and
to rest upon the Fundamental Gneiss. In it are found all the
mineral deposits of economic value—apatite, iron ore, asbestos,
etc., which occur in the Laurentian. The rocks of this series,
though generally highly inclined, over some large areas lie nearly
horizontal or are inclined at very low angles, but even in such
cases they show evidence of having been subjected to great
pressure, resulting in some cases in the horizontal disruption of
certain of the beds.</p>

<p>The areas occupied by the Grenville series although of very
considerable extent, being known to aggregate many thousand
square miles, are probably small as compared with those underlain
by the Fundamental Gneiss. The relative distribution of the
two series has not been ascertained except in a general way in the
more easily-accessible parts of the great Archean Protaxis. The
Grenville series is known to occupy a large part of its southern
margin between the city of Quebec and the Georgian Bay, while
the discovery of crystalline limestone in the gneiss elsewhere at
several widely separated points, as for instance on the Hamilton
River in Labrador, in the southern part of Baffin Land and on
the Melville Peninsula, makes it probable that other considerable
areas will, with the progress of geological exploration, be found
in the far north. Over the greater part of the Protaxis, however,
the more monotonous development of the Fundamental
Gneiss seems to prevail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
The question of the origin and mutual relations of the Fundamental
Gneiss and the Grenville series is one about which,
though much has been written but little is known. Three views
may be taken on the <span class="locked">matter—</span></p>

<p>(1) The Fundamental Gneiss may be supposed to contain
what remains of a primitive crust, penetrated by great masses of
igneous rock erupted through it—the whole having been subjected
to repeated dynamic action.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The Grenville Series may
be an upward continuation or development of the Fundamental
Gneiss under altered conditions, marking in the history of the
world the transition from those conditions under which a primitive
crust formed to those in which sedimentation under the
present normal conditions took place. It would seem that if the
earth originally had a crust on which the first sediments were
deposited when the temperature became sufficiently low to permit
water to condense, that the said water, at a very high temperature
and under what are to us now inconceivable conditions
but little removed from fusion, might give rise to sediments not
altogether similar to those formed by the ordinary processes of
erosion at the present time. Also that, under the unique conditions
which must have prevailed at that early time, in the formation
of a crust solidification, precipitation and sedimentation
might go on to a certain extent concomitantly, and thus no well-defined
break could be detected, or would in fact exist, between
a primitive crust formed by solidification from a fused magma
and the earliest aqueous sediments or deposits. The Fundamental
Gneiss and the Grenville Series might thus, as Logan
supposed, form one practically continuous series and represent
parts of the original crust, with the first crystalline or clastic
sediments deposited on it, the whole penetrated by eruptive
rocks and folded up and altered by repeated dynamic action at
subsequent periods.</p>

<p>The general petrographical similarity of the two series, taken
in connection with the more varied nature of the Grenville Series,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
its frequent stratified character, and the presence in it of limestones
and graphite indicating an approach to modern conditions
and the advent of life, together with the difficulty of clearly separating
the two series from one another and defining their respective
limits, lends support to this view.</p>

<p>(2) A second view is that the Grenville Series is distinct from
the Fundamental Gneiss reposing on it unconformably and of
much more recent age; that it consists of a highly altered
series of clastic origin—the Fundamental Gneiss having possibly
some such origin as that mentioned under the last heading, or
representing a much older series of still more highly altered
sediments. This is supported by the fact that some observers
have thought they could in places trace out a line of contact
between the two. But in these cases it always becomes a matter
of serious doubt whether what has been considered to represent
the Fundamental Gneiss is not really a mass of intrusive rock,
in which, by pressure or motion, a somewhat gneissic structure
has been induced. If the Fundamental Gneiss, moreover, was
ever an ordinary sediment, it must have undergone a metamorphosis
so profound that no trace of clastic origin remains, unless
the generally indistinct foliation or banding of some portions of
it be considered as such. It must also be noted in this connection
that, although the rocks of the Grenville series are more
frequently possessed of a decided foliation and are often banded,
bands of different composition alternating with one another as
in ordinary sedimentary deposits, and although in this series
crystalline limestones and quartzites occur, we have as yet no
absolutely conclusive proof that even they are of sedimentary
origin. The series is thoroughly crystalline, most of its members
at least show the effect of great dynamic action, and so far as the
present writer is aware, no undoubted conglomerate or finer grained
rock showing distinct clastic structure has ever been found. In
view of this fact,—although the series is, in all probability, made
up in part at least and perhaps wholly of sedimentary material,—the
proposal to separate it from the rest of the Laurentian
and class it as Algonkian or Huronian seems at least premature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
(3) A third view which has been advanced is that the Fundamental
Gneiss is nothing more than a great mass of eruptive
granite or granitic rock which has eaten upward, and in places penetrated
the Grenville series, or perhaps absorbed it, while the Grenville
series itself represents a series of highly altered sediments
of Laurentian, Huronian or subsequent age. The enormous extent
and world-wide distribution of the Fundamental Gneiss forming
as it does wherever the base of the geological column is exposed
to view, the foundation or floor on which all subsequent rocks
are seen to rest, is opposed to this view of its origin, as is also
its persistent gneissic or banded character, although, as above
mentioned, much eruptive material is undoubtedly to be found
in it.</p>

<p>Which of these views is correct can be ascertained only as
very careful and detailed mapping, accompanied by accurate
petrographical study, is proceeded with. In the present state of
our knowledge additional argument and discussion will not help
us toward the goal, while hasty work and generalization serves
but to retard the progress of our knowledge.</p>

<p><i>The Anorthosite Series.</i>—Associated with both the series of
rocks just described there are, as has been mentioned, great
eruptive masses of granite, some of which have been folded in
with the gneisses, while others evidently erupted at a much later
date, show no trace of dynamic action.</p>

<p>In addition to these, basic eruptive rocks belonging to the
gabbro family occur in certain districts, sometimes in the form of
comparatively insignificant masses, but elsewhere underlying
great tracts of country. One on the upper waters of the Saguenay
has an area of no less than 5,800 square miles. These
usually consist of a variety of gabbro in which the magnesia-iron
constituents are present in very small amount, being in many
cases entirely wanting, so that the rock consists practically of
pure plagioclase feldspar. These rocks were called <em>anorthosites</em>
by Hunt, in the early reports of the Canadian Geological Survey,
on account of the great preponderance in them of “Anorthose,”
a general name given many years ago by Delesse to the triclinic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
feldspars, as distinguished from “Orthose,” or orthoclase feldspar,
and thus equivalent to the term plagioclase now in general use,
but having no connection with anorthite, a variety of plagioclase
which is seldom present. After a careful study of these rocks,
both in the field and the laboratory, it is believed that this name
should be retained for this well-marked member of the gabbro
family, which, though not a common rock elsewhere, has an
enormous distribution in the Laurentian of Canada.</p>

<p>If an olivine gabbro be regarded as the central member, so
to speak, of the gabbro family, the replacement of the monoclinic
by rhombic pyroxene will give rise to an olivine norite.
A gradual diminution in the amount of plagioclase will give rise
to a peridotite or gabbro pyroxenite, a diminution in the amount
of pyroxene to a troktolite or plagioclase-olivine rock, while a
diminution in the amount of olivine and pyroxene will give rise
to an anorthosite, which variety forms the greater part of the
intrusive masses in question. The gradual passage of one variety
into another can be distinctly traced in many localities in the
anorthosite masses. These anorthosites are in some places massive,
but very frequently show a distinct foliation, often very
perfect. In some places they occur interbanded with the gneiss
and crystalline limestone, while elsewhere they cut directly
across the strike of these rocks. The interbanded anorthosite,
together with the gneiss and limestone associated with it, was
supposed by Logan to form a distinct sedimentary series, to
which the name “Upper Laurentian,” or “Norian,” was given,
because the discovery that elsewhere the anorthosite runs across
the strike of the gneiss was supposed to indicate that this series
covered up and unconformably overlay the Grenville series, the
igneous and intrusive character of the anorthosite not being
recognized on account of its frequently foliated structure. It is
now known that these anorthosites do not constitute an independent
formation, but are igneous rocks which occur, cutting
both the Grenville series and the Fundamental gneiss. They
have, however, in many cases been intruded before the cessation
of the great dynamic movements to which the Laurentian was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
subjected in pre-Cambrian times, and thus frequently taking
a line of least resistance and having been intruded between the
bands or strata of the Grenville series, have had a foliation
induced in them parallel to that of the gneiss, while in other
cases where they are more or less massive, they cut across the
strike of the latter.</p>

<p>In many cases the anorthosites which exhibit a perfect foliation
may be traced step by step into the massive variety, the
gradual development of a foliated structure in the rock being
accompanied by a progressive granulation of the constituents,
most beautifully seen under the microscope. The change, however,
differs from any hitherto described in that it is purely
mechanical. There are no lines of shearing with accompanying
chemical changes, but a breaking up of the constituents throughout
the whole mass, though in some places this has progressed
much further than in others, unaccompanied by any alteration of
augite or hypersthene to hornblende, or of plagioclase to saussurite,
these minerals, though prone to such alteration under pressure
remaining quite unaltered, suffering merely a granulation with
the arrangement of the granulated material in parallel strings.
This process can be observed in all its stages, and there is reason
to believe that it has been brought about by pressure acting on
the rocks when they were deeply buried and very hot.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The
anorthosite areas, of which there are about a dozen of great
extent with many of smaller size, are distributed along the south
and southeastern edge of the main Archean Protaxis from Labrador
to Lake Champlain, occupying in this way a position
similar to that of volcanoes along the edge of our present continents.
Curiously enough precisely similar occurrences of this
anorthosite have been found in connection with similar gneissic
rocks, supposed to be of Archean age, in Russia, Norway and
Egypt. These anorthosite rocks being intrusive, may be left out
of consideration in endeavoring to work out the succession of
the Archean in this great area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
The whole Laurentian system, including the anorthosites, is
in many places cut by numerous dykes of large size, which can
often be traced for great distances. These are of several kinds,
the principal series consisting of a beautiful fresh diabase often
holding quartz in considerable amount in micro-pegmatitic intergrowths
with plagioclase. Other sets of dykes and eruptive
masses consisting of augite and mica syenites, quartz-porphyries
and other rocks are also known to occur but have not as yet
been carefully studied.</p>

<p><i>The Hastings Series.</i>—The stratigraphical relations of the
Hastings series have not as yet been satisfactorily determined.
The rocks constituting the series differ widely in petrographical
character from those of the Fundamental Gneiss and the Grenville
series, both of which are supposed to occur in its immediate
neighborhood. The series consists largely of calc-schists, mica-schists,
dolomites, slates and conglomerates, thus containing much
material of undoubtedly clastic origin. It has moreover a very
local development, being confined, so far as at present known,
to one small corner of the area, as has been mentioned. It was
by Logan supposed to come in above the Grenville series, while
Vennor who subsequently examined the district, believed it to
be equivalent to the lower part of this series. That we have in
the Hastings series a comparatively unaltered part of the Grenville
series, made up largely of rocks whose origin is easily recognized,
would be a most important fact if established, and
would, of course, afford a key to the whole question of the
origin of the latter. This is a conclusion, however, which cannot
be accepted until supported by very clear and decisive evidence,
especially as the stratigraphy of the Hastings district is very
complicated, the several series represented in it being much
folded and penetrated by great masses of eruptive rocks. The
whole district has also been subject to great dynamic action,
some of the pebbles in the conglomerates of the Hastings series
being distorted in a most remarkable manner. This series may
prove to be merely an outlying area of Huronian rocks folded in
with the Laurentian, and until the district has been studied in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
detail its stratigraphical position must remain a matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>Leaving the Hastings series out of consideration therefore, we
have in this Original and Typical Laurentian area two developments
of the Laurentian, generally considered as constituting
two series, namely the</p>

<div class="center"><div class="ilb">
<p class="in0">Grenville or Upper series,<br />
Fundamental, Ottawa, or Lower Gneiss.
</p>
</div></div>

<p><i>The Evolution of the Area.</i>—In endeavoring to outline the main
events in the evolution of this area it will be necessary to extend
the limits of our observation somewhat and seek for evidence
bearing on the question in other parts of the Protaxis, where we
meet with developments of Huronian and various earlier Paleozoic
strata not found in the typical area itself.</p>

<p>From the highly contorted condition of the Laurentian rocks
of this area as well as from the abundant evidences of dynamic
action which they present both in the field and under the microscope,
it is evident that they have been subjected to great orographic
forces, which in very early times threw them up into
mountain ranges, probably of great height. Some of the associated
eruptive rocks were intruded before these movements began,
or while they were in progress and have accordingly been influenced
by them, while others, having been intruded later, have
not been affected.</p>

<p>How high these mountains rose cannot of course be determined.
Bell states that some of the mountains on the Labrador
coast now rise to a height of from 5,000 to 6,000 feet, while
Lieber has estimated that on the coast of Northern Labrador
they rise to a height of from 6,000 to 10,000 feet. Along the
southern part of the Protaxis, where the country is much lower,
notwithstanding the enormous subaerial denudation and glaciation
which the area has repeatedly undergone, there are many
points still rising from 2,500 to 3,500 feet above sea level, while
Logan estimated that the average elevation is from 1,500 to
1,600 feet. In the Adirondacks, which are but an outlying
portion of this area, there are elevations of over 5,400 feet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
The high elevations attained by these rocks in portions of the
Protaxis in the north may, of course, be due to differential elevation,
but immediately along the southern edge of the area
there can have been but little differential change of level as
compared with the flat-lying Potsdam strata which border it
and lie but little above the present sea level. Further evidence
of the original height or continued uprising of the area
is afforded by the fact that all the material of which the North
American continent was built up (with the possible exception of
some of the limestones) was derived originally from the Archean
Protaxis of the continent, a considerable proportion of this at
least coming from the main Protaxis of which this typical
Laurentian area forms a part. We must conclude therefore
that in early Cambrian or pre-Cambrian times, in portions of
the Protaxis at least, the Laurentian mountains rose several
hundred and possibly in places several thousand feet above the
sea level.</p>

<p>The intrusion of the granites and anorthosites as well as the
folding of the whole system of rocks took place before Upper
Cambrian times. The whole series was moreover without doubt
at that time in the “metamorphic” condition in which we now
find it, for along the margin of the area the Potsdam sandstone
rests in flat undisturbed beds on the deeply eroded remnants of
these old mountains, its basal beds often consisting of a conglomerate
with pebbles of the underlying gneissic rocks. These
Cambrian strata cover up the gneisses, granites and anorthosites
alike and are evidently of much more recent age, being separated
from the Laurentian by the long interval occupied in the upheaval
and erosion of the Laurentian area.</p>

<p>How long before Upper Cambrian times this folding and
erosion took place cannot be determined from a study of this
area, but further west along the edge of the Protaxis in the Lake
Superior district we find that the Keweenawan, Nipigon and
Animikie Series also repose in flat undisturbed beds on the
eroded remnants of a series of crystalline rocks which have the
petrographical character of the Fundamental Gneiss. This
makes it at least very probable that in this eastern area also the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
erosion took place in pre-Cambrian times.</p>

<p>It is a very remarkable fact that the roche moutonné
character possessed by these eroded Laurentian rocks and which
is usually attributed to the glaciation which they underwent in
Pleistocene times, was really impressed upon them in the first
instance in these pre-Cambrian times, for all along the edge of
the nucleus from Lake Superior to the Saguenay, the Paleozoic
strata, often in little patches, can be seen to overlie and cover up
a mammillated and roche moutonné surface showing no traces
of decay and similar to that exposed over the uncovered part of
the area. The conclusion therefore seems inevitable that not
only were these Laurentian rocks sharply folded and subjected
to enormous erosion, but that they had given to them in pre-Cambrian
times their peculiar hummocky contours so suggestive
of ice action.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The pre-Paleozoic surface of the Fundamental
Gneiss of Scotland, as Sir Archibald Geikie has shown, also
presents the same hummocky character.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> On this surface the
Upper Huronian, Cambrian, and later Paleozoic rocks were
deposited.</p>

<p>To what extent the seas of Cambrian, Silurian and Devonian
times passed over this area cannot be determined with certainty.
A great series of rocks referred to by Dr. G. M. Dawson as
probably of Lower Cambrian age and analogous in character to
the Keweenawan and Animikie series occur overlying the Laurentian
in many parts of the Protaxis, not only along its margin,
but as outliers at many places in the interior. It occurs extensively
developed about the Arctic Ocean and about Hudson’s
Bay, and a large area of rocks referred to the same age also
occur near the height of land about Lake Mistassini. “Throughout
the whole of the vast northern part of the continent this
characteristic Cambrian formation, composed largely of volcanic
rocks, apparently occupies the same unconformable position with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
regard to the underlying Laurentian and Huronian systems. Its
present remnants serve to indicate the position of some of the
earliest geological basins, which from the attitude of the rocks
appear to have undergone comparatively little disturbance. Its
extent entitles it to be recognized as one of the most important
geological features of North America.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> It would, therefore,
seem that in Cambrian times a not inconsiderable part of the
Archean Nucleus was under water. Outliers of Cambro-Silurian
age are also found at several points lying well within the margin
of the Nucleus, as for instance in the Ottawa River about
Pembroke at a distance of fifty miles, and at Lake St. John at
the head of the Saguenay River at a distance of one hundred
and thirty miles from its present limit. There is reason to
believe that a similar outlier exists in the interior of the northern
part of the Peninsula of Labrador, so that the Lower Paleozoic
sea must also have covered considerable areas in the eastern half
of the Protaxis, where now nothing but Laurentian is to be seen.
In that portion of the Protaxis lying to the west of Hudson’s
Bay strata of Cambro-Silurian and Devonian age extend up from
the basin of Hudson’s Bay on the east and from the great plains
on the west far over the Laurentian Plateau and probably,
according to Dr. Dawson, originally inosculated. Strata of
Upper Silurian and Devonian age are not known to exist in the
eastern half of the Protaxis, of which the typical Laurentian area
forms part, with the exception of a small outlier of Niagara age
on Lake Temiscamangue at the head waters of the Ottawa—neither
do any other deposits of later age occur with the exception
of the Glacial Drift. What evidence there is, therefore,
would rather indicate that the area, during late Paleozoic,
Mesozoic and earlier Tertiary times, was out of water. If so, it
must have undergone during this great lapse of ages a process
of deep seated decay and denudation, culminating in the extensive
glaciation to which it was subjected in Pleistocene times.</p>

<p>During this latter period the whole area was exposed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
ice action, with the exception of the highest part of the Nucleus—the
mountains of the Labrador coast—which, except toward
the base, are still “softened, eroded and deeply decayed.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
This extensive denudation served to remove all but mere remnants
of any Paleozoic strata originally deposited on the Archean
of this area, while the deep decay of the Archean rocks themselves
would account for the immense numbers of gneiss bowlders
in the drift, which in all probability are but smoothed cores of
“bowlders of decomposition.” That an immense amount of
material was removed from the surface of the area during the
glacial age is shown by the immense quantities of Archean
material which occurs scattered over the surface of the Nucleus
itself, as well as in the drift to the south. The glaciation, with
the depression and uplift which succeeded it, was the last
episode in the evolution of this “original” Laurentian area and
one which impressed upon it its present surface characters and
type of landscape.</p>

<p>It is now an immense uneven plateau, comparatively slightly
accentuated except along the Labrador coast. The surface is
covered with glaciated hills and bosses of rock with rounded,
mammilated, flowing contours interspersed with drift covered
flats and studded with thousands upon thousands of lakes great
and small. A country which in the far north is often bleak and
desolate, but to the south, where it is covered with luxuriant
forest, is often of great beauty, especially when clothed with the
brilliant foliage of autumn. Even now, however, it is passing
into a further stage of its history, the smooth or polished
glaciated surfaces are becoming roughened by decay, the softer
gneissic and limestone strata are again commencing to crumble
into soil, and a new epoch has been inaugurated in which the
marks of the ice age are being gradually effaced.</p>

<h2 id="MELILITE-NEPHELINE-BASALT">MELILITE-NEPHELINE-BASALT AND NEPHELINE-BASANITE
FROM SOUTHERN TEXAS.</h2>
</div>

<p>These basaltic rocks were collected by Professor Dumble and
Mr. Taff, in Uvalde County, southern Texas. On the geological
map of the United States, compiled by C. H. Hitchcock, 1886,
there are two of the localities marked near the boundary of
the Cretaceous and earlier Tertiary formation, between 99° and
100° longitude, and on the 29th degree of latitude. According
to the statement of Professor Dumble, one part of the rocks
appears in dikes in the upper portion of the lower Cretaceous
formation, while the other forms hills and buttes. Upon microscopical
examination it is evident that the specimens collected
belong to two different groups of rocks. The microscope shows
that those occurring in dikes consist of typical melilite-bearing
nepheline-basalt, while those making up hills and buttes
are nepheline-basanites tending toward phonolites in composition.</p>

<p>The melilite-nepheline-basalts have a typical basaltic appearance.
In a dense black groundmass, the only phenocrysts seen
by the naked eye are numerous olivines. Under the microscope
there appear in addition to the olivine the following minerals:
augite, nepheline, melilite, magnetite and perovskite. As to the
proportion of nepheline and melilite, it can be said, that in
nearly all the specimens examined, the two minerals are found in
about the same amount. For this reason these rocks can be
placed under the head of nepheline-basalt as well as under that
of melilite-basalt, or they may be called melilite-nepheline-basalt.
Only one of the specimens is entirely free from melilite. Feldspar
is wholly wanting. All of the specimens are in a very
fresh condition, and even the melilite shows only slight indications
of decomposition. The specimen free from melilite corresponds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
in structure and composition with the other specimens,
except for the absence of melilite and perovskite, and so they
may be described together.</p>

<p>All the rocks are porphyritic, since they bear large phenocrysts
of olivine. Under the microscope the olivine is colorless and transparent,
and only shows indications of serpentinization along the
edges and fissures. It contains rounded inclusions of glass,
abundant in some sections, besides octahedrons of magnetite, and
others that are transparent with a brownish violet color. Whether
the latter are a mineral of the spinel-group or belong to perovskite,
with which they accord in color, could not be decided.</p>

<p>Augite occurs in only one generation; phenocrysts of augite
are wanting. In the rather coarse-grained groundmass, it becomes
the most abundant constituent. The mineral shows a
grayish-brown color, common to basaltic augite, sometimes with
a tint of violet. It generally forms well-shaped crystals, rarely
irregular grains, and bears inclusions of magnetite and glass.</p>

<p>Melilite occurs in the groundmass in large and well-shaped
crystals, its dimensions never becoming as small as those of
many of the augite crystals. They may be designated as micro-porphyritical
phenocrysts. Cross sections parallel to (001)
reach a diameter of 0.5 mm. The shape of the melilite is the
common one, tabular parallel to (001). The diameter of the
tables generally exceeds their thickness from four to six times.
Sections parallel to the prism-zone, therefore, are lath-shaped and
the vertical axis lies perpendicular to their length; the axis of
greatest elasticity coincides with the vertical axis. Between
crossed nicols these sections show the particular blue interference
colors characteristic of melilite and zoisite. Sections perpendicular
to the prism-zone are eight-sided by reason of the planes
(110) and (100), but frequently the outlines are rounded. In
some of the sections examined the melilite incloses minute
opaque grains arranged zonally, which present very sharply the
prismatic outlines of their host. Besides the two prismatic faces
above mentioned, there is also a ditetragonal prism, the angle of
which upon the adjoining faces of (110) and (100) was found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
to be nearly equal, 20°-22°. According to this measurement the
prism must have approximately the position of (940); the angle
of the latter upon (110) is 21° 2´, the angle upon (100) = 23° 58´.
A particular phenomenon in the growth of the melilite is the fact
that the base does not generally present an even plane, but shows
a conical depression. The shape of the lath-shaped sections
then resembles the profile of a biconcave lens. Sections parallel
to the base are isotropic between crossed nicols and show, when
they are not too thin, an indistinct dark cross in convergent light.
The cleavage parallel to (001), the cross-fibration of the lath-shaped
sections and the occurrence of the spear-shaped and peg-shaped
inclusions arranged parallel to the <i>c</i> axis (the so-called
<em>Pflockstruktur</em>) are very distinct. Inclusions of pyroxene, magnetite
and glass are common; as already mentioned, these inclusions
are generally arranged in zones. In sections parallel to
(001) they fill the central parts of their host, and often make
up two or three concentric zones. These sections closely resemble
leucite because of their rounded shape, the arrangement
of the inclusions and the lack of double refraction. Melilite
becomes nearly colorless and transparent, but in comparing it
with the white, colorless nepheline, it shows a feeble yellow tint.
Decomposition has taken place to only a small extent; it begins
along the cross-fibration, and greenish-yellow alteration-products
result, the fibres of which are perpendicular to the length
of the lath-shaped sections.</p>

<p>Nepheline is always fresh, colorless and transparent; it rarely
exhibits a regular shape, but generally forms an aggregate of
irregular grains, cementing the other components; it is evidently
the latest formed mineral in the rock.</p>

<p>There is abundant magnetite besides perovskite, the common
associate of melilite, which occurs in small octahedrons and irregular
grains. The perovskite becomes transparent with a
brownish-violet color, and shows in some sections a feeble, abnormal
double refraction. There appears to be no isotropic base
in the normal rock, but if any is present, it must be in a very
small amount. There are coarser grained spots in the rock,
which are rich in a partly chloritized base, and in which nepheline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
occurs in well-shaped crystals.</p>

<p>The second group of rocks, as already mentioned, falls under
the head of nepheline-basanite poor in olivine. And since
the specimens bear sanidine phenocrysts beside plagioclase,
it forms a transition to phonolite. The rock-specimens have
a more andesitic than basaltic appearance. Numerous phenocrysts
of hornblende and augite are imbedded in the dense bluish-gray
groundmass. The next most abundant mineral is nepheline
in the form of phenocrysts, in part well-shaped crystals, in
part rounded, the largest of which are 0.5 cm. in diameter. The
nepheline differs from the feldspar in having a grayish color and
greasy lustre. Phenocrysts of feldspar and crystals of olivine are
scarce. Beside these components, the rocks contain apatite,
some titanite and iron ores. Under the microscope olivine is seen
to be scarce. It is fresh and shows the normal properties. It contains
minute octahedrons of picotite and in some sections abundant
inclusions of a liquid with moving bubbles.</p>

<p>The amphibole mineral is a typical basaltic hornblende. It becomes
transparent with a dark reddish-brown color and exhibits
a strong pleochroism according to the following scheme:</p>

<p><b>a</b>, brownish yellow, <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> dark reddish brown. Absorption,
<b>c &gt; b &gt; a</b>.</p>

<p>The angle of extinction was examined in sections cut approximately
parallel to the clinopinacoid (010) and was determined to
be very small. This fact and the dark reddish-brown color are in
all probability due to a high amount of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The dependence
of the angle of extinction upon the amount of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in minerals
of the amphibole group has been recently established by Schneider
and Belowsky. The basaltic hornblende shows the well-known
dark borders produced by reabsorption by the magma in
an early stage of consolidation. In many cases nothing of the
original mineral is preserved; the whole hornblende is replaced by
a fine grained aggregate of pyroxene and magnetite, presenting
clearly the outlines of the absorbed mineral.</p>

<p>The group of pyroxenic minerals is represented by two monoclinic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
augites. One of them exhibits a violet-gray color in thin
section and belongs to the basaltic augites; the other one becomes
transparent with a dark green color. Both form numerous phenocrysts,
but the first occurs somewhat more frequently. They
occur as single crystals and are also grown together in a zonal
manner, the green one always forming the center, the gray one
the outer parts of the crystals. Hence the gray augite is the
younger. The pyroxene in the groundmass shows the same
color and properties. The pleochroism of the two minerals is as
follows:</p>

<table summary="pleochroism of the two minerals">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl" colspan="3">Gray augite.</td>

    <td class="tdl norpad"><b>c</b></td>
    <td class="tdl">Dark green.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The angle of extinction, <i>c</i>: <b>c</b>, is large and, as may be seen in
the zonal crystals, it is somewhat larger in the gray pyroxene
than in the green. The extinction in sections cut approximately
parallel to (010) has been observed to be about 47 degrees (gray
augite) and 41 degrees (green augite). The two pyroxenes show
in addition to the cleavage parallel to (110) another but less
distinct one parallel to (010). Inclusions of magnetite, apatite
and glass are common.</p>

<p>Phenocrysts of feldspar are scarce. In part they show the polysynthetic
twinning lamination of plagioclase; in part the latter is
wanting and one of the latter feldspars, which was isolated and examined
for specific gravity and optical properties, was found to be
sanidine. Phenocrysts of nepheline are more frequent than those
of feldspar. The mineral appears partly in the form of short-prismatic
crystals, partly in rounded grains. It presents distinct
cleavage, parallel to (1010) and to (0001), and the usually observed
optical properties. Isolated grains are decomposed by
hydrochloric acid with the separation of gelatinous silica; the resulting
solution when evaporated gives numerous cubes of NaCl.
Inclusions are scarce; there are fluid cavities with moving bubbles,
generally arranged in rows, besides some pyroxene crystals.</p>

<p>Apatite forms short and stout crystals always filled with inclusions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
of liquids. The opaque ore grains, judging by their ready
solubility, belong to magnetite. The groundmass of these rocks
consists essentially of pyroxene in well-shaped prisms, lath-shaped
feldspar, without twinning lamination or in single twins
according to the Carlsbad law and nepheline. The feldspar of
the groundmass in all probability is mostly sanidine. Nepheline
is abundant and occurs in well-shaped crystals. Small patches
of a colorless base occur between the crystalline components.</p>

<p>The structure of the rocks is hypocrystalline-porphyritic on
account of the occurrence of an isotropic base and the repetition of
the crystallization of pyroxene, nepheline and feldspar. Although
the specimens by their whole habit and structure belong under
the head of nepheline-basanite poor in olivine, the presence of
sanidine as phenocrysts causes them to form a transition to the
group of phonolites. Unfortunately, analyses of these rocks
have not yet been made.</p>

<p>A microscopical examination of the basaltic rock from Pilot
Knob, near Austin, Travis County, was made for the purpose of
comparison with the rocks from southern Texas just described.
The rock was found to be a nepheline-basalt porphyritic with
numerous phenocrysts of olivine. The fine grained groundmass
consists essentially of augite-crystals cemented by non-individualized
nepheline in very small amount.</p>

<h2 id="SOME_DYNAMIC_PHENOMENA">SOME DYNAMIC PHENOMENA SHOWN BY THE
BARABOO QUARTZITE RANGES OF
CENTRAL WISCONSIN.</h2>
</div>

<p>The quartzite ranges of Baraboo extend east and west for
about thirty miles, one lying north, and the other, the main
range, lying south of the City of Baraboo. The geology of
this district is admirably given by the late Professor Irving.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
Not only is the general geology clearly described, but remarkably
accurate descriptions are given of the character of the
quartzite, and the phenomena shown by it, considering the fact
that the report was written nearly twenty years since. The
unconformity existing between the quartzite and the Cambrian
was later more fully described.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The induration of the Baraboo
quartzite has been explained as due to the enlargement of the
original quartz grains; and to the deposition of independent
interstitial quartz.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The present note is based upon recent
observations on the East Bluff at Devil’s Lake and on the
exposures at the Upper Narrows of the Baraboo River.</p>

<p>The section across the ranges, as given by Irving, is shown
by <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>. The two ranges together, as thus represented, are
less than the north half of a great anticline, the south side of
the south range being near its crown. This structure involves a
very great thickness of quartzite, and was offered with reservation
by Professor Irving. He says: “The hypothesis is not
altogether satisfactory. The entire disappearance of the other
side of the great arch, as well as the peculiar ways in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
ranges come together at their extremities are difficult to explain
by it. It may be said in this connection that the dip observations
toward the west are not so satisfactory or numerous as they
might be.” The question naturally arises whether or not the
great width of the ranges in the central part of the area may
not be partly explained by monoclinal faulting, and thus reduce
the supposed thickness of the beds.</p>

<p>The layers of quartzite are ordinarily very heavy, but the
changing character of the original sediment is such as to make
it easy to follow the layers. Some beds were composed of fine
grains of quartz, mingled with clayey material, others of coarse
grains with little clayey material, and others of pebbles so large
as to pass into an unmistakable conglomerate. The pebbles of
the conglomerate are mainly white quartz and red jasper. It is
thus easy to discriminate the bedding of the series from the
heavy jointing which occurs, cutting the bedding in various
directions, and from a secondary cleavage and foliation which
occurs in certain localities.</p>

<p>From the general work of many geologists on dynamic
action in folding, it is to be expected that the amount of movement
necessary for accommodation between beds, and consequently
the dynamic metamorphism resulting from shearing,
would be less near the crown of the anticline than on the leg of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
the fold. That is, dynamic metamorphism ought not to be so
extensive in the south range as in the north range. The facts
described by Irving,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> and those noted by me, fully agree with
this anticipation. The central parts of the heavy, little inclined
beds of the south range are largely indurated by simple enlargement.
The pressure has not been sufficient to obliterate the
cores, but has apparently granulated the exterior of some of the
larger fragments, as in hand specimens the exteriors of the large
blue quartz grains are white. Very generally the grains show
slight wavy extinction. A few of them are distinctly cracked.
The crevices thus formed and those in the interstices have been
filled in large part by infiltrated silica, but their positions are
plainly indicated by difference in extinction, by bubbles, by iron
oxide, or by secondary mica which has taken advantage of the
minute crevices.</p>

<p>However, as described by Irving, between the heavy beds of
quartzites are often layers, cut by a diagonal cleavage which
dies out in passing into the thick beds. The layers showing
cleavage sometimes pass into those showing the beginning of
foliation, the rock then nearing a schist. In the centers of the
schist zones, the schistosity approaches parallelism with the
bedding, and in passing outward curves from this direction until
it crosses the bedding at an angle, at the same time becoming
less marked and grading into ordinary cleavage, which dies out
in the quartzite. Upon the opposite side the transition is of the
same character, but the curve is in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Irving apparently regarded these shear zones as originally
beds of a different character from the adjacent quartzite, and his
conclusion is fully borne out by the thin sections. The microscope
shows that the grains of quartz are of small size, and
separated to a greater or a less extent by interstitial clayey
material. Because of this partial separation of the grains of
quartz, they have not been granulated to the extent that one would
expect from the schistosity of the rock, most of the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
cores being plainly visible. They, however, often show wavy
extinction and even cracks, but not to a greater degree than the
grains in the massive quartzite; for in the latter the full stress of
the pressure has been borne by the grains in full touch, not
separated by a plastic matrix, as are the grains of quartz in the
argillaceous layers. In the matrix of the schist are numerous
small flakes of muscovite, arranged with their longer axes in
a common direction, much finely crystalline quartz, and a good
deal of iron oxide.</p>

<p>It is concluded that the clayey character of the beds, and,
consequently, the greater ease of movement within them, has
located the slipping-planes and shear-zones, necessary in order to
accommodate the beds to their new positions. On the south range,
near Devil’s Lake, these shear-zones are generally not more than
six or eight inches wide. They may be well seen just back of
the Cliff House, and on the Northwestern Railway, about one-half
mile south of this house. All of these shear-zones are parallel
with the bedding, and illustrate the possibility, so far as I know
first mentioned by H. L. Smyth, that a crystalline schist, with
schistosity parallel to bedding, may be produced by shearing
along the bedding-planes.</p>

<p>On the railroad track, near the locality where these shear-zones
may be seen, is also an almost vertical shear-zone, two to
four feet wide. It therefore cuts almost directly across the beds
of quartzite, which here incline to the south about twelve or
thirteen degrees. Throughout this band, the quartzite is broken
into angular trapezoidal fragments, the longer directions of which
are vertical, and which may be picked out with the hammer. In
certain parts of the zone well-defined gruss or friction clay
produced by the grinding of the fragments against one another,
has been produced. This is clearly a plane of faulting. How
much the throw of this fault is it is not easy to say, as the heavy
beds of quartzite are so similar that it is impossible to certainly
identify them. At this place there is, however, a change in the
character of the quartzite, layers of light color being overlain by
other beds, which are more heavily stained with iron oxide. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
same succession is seen on both sides of the fault, and if beds
of like character correspond, the amount of the throw is twenty
to thirty feet, and the south side has dropped relative to the
north side. In other words, the faulting is in the right direction
to reduce the theoretical thickness of the sediments as given by
Irving. The district has not been closely examined for other
faults, but the existence of one fault, even of a minor character,
suggests that a careful study of the whole area with reference to
faulting should be made, in order to determine what deductions
may possibly be made from Irving’s estimate of the probable
thickness of the quartzite.</p>

<p>At the upper narrows of the Baraboo, near Ablemans, we
are on the north leg of the anticline. The dip is throughout
from seventy to ninety to the north, and in some places the
layers are slightly overturned. The slipping along the bedding
has here been much greater. While in this area there are heavy
beds of quartzite which have not suffered great interior movement,
other beds have been sheared throughout, being transformed
macroscopically into a quartz-schist, but the foliation is strongly
developed. In other places, as described by Irving,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> where the
rock is a purer quartzite, for a distance of 200 feet or more
across the strike, the rocks have been shattered through and
through, and re-cemented by vein quartz.</p>

<p>For the most part the rock is merely fractured, the quartz
fragments roughly fitting one another, but there are all gradations
from this phase to a belt about ten feet wide of true
friction conglomerate, the fragments having been ground against
one another until they have become well-rounded (a Reibungs
breccia). Between the boulders of this zone is a matrix,
composed mainly of smaller quartzite fragments. The whole
has been re-cemented, so that now the mass is completely vitreous.
This belt of friction conglomerate at first might not be discriminated
from the Potsdam conglomerate, immediately adjacent,
but a closer study shows how radically different they are. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
one the cementing material is vein-quartz; in the other the
sandstone has been feebly cemented by quartz enlargement.</p>

<p>A movement later than the one which produced the cemented
fractured rocks and breccia has broken broad zones of the
massive beds of quartzite into lozenge-shaped blocks, the longer
axes of which are parallel to the bedding and movement. These
later-formed blocks have not been re-cemented by secondary
quartz, and the cracks are taken advantage of in quarrying, the
fragments being easily picked apart. Thus the rock has been
affected by at least two dynamic movements, separated by a
considerable interval of time.</p>

<p>The shear-zones, often several feet in width, particularly
affect the more finely-laminated layers, which are lean in quartz,
while the relief in the more massive layers has resulted in complex
fracturing. In the first phase of production of the schist,
the irregular fractures pass into rather regular fractures, cutting the
beds nearly at right angles. As the action becomes more intense
in the more argillaceous beds, the angle of fracture, or cleavage,
as it may now fairly be called, becomes more acute, and in the
most intense phase this cleaved rock passes into a well-developed
schist, the foliation of which is parallel to the bedding.
The phenomena of shearing are here therefore very similar to
those at Devil’s Lake, except that the process has gone
farther.</p>

<p>When studied in thin section, the massive beds of quartzite
show more decided effects of dynamic action than at Devil’s
Lake. However, the major portions of the grains of quartz
have distinct cores which are often beautifully enlarged. In
some cases nearly every grain has thus grown, perfectly indurating
the rock. But, also, nearly every grain of quartz has a wavy
extinction, and many of them have been fractured, as mentioned
of a few of the quartz grains of the quartzites of the south range.
In one case the pressure has been so great as to produce rather
numerous roughly parallel lines of fracture. It is thus seen that
the dynamic effects are not confined to the schist zones, but are
also prominent within the heavy beds of quartzite. This was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
be expected; for while the major part of the accommodation
necessary to bend the rock mass as a whole took place along
the shear zones, the accommodation required to bend each
of the rigid heavy beds of quartzite must have taken place
within each layer. To the consequent intense pressure and the
rubbing of the grains over one another, are wholly attributed
their wavy extinction and fractures.</p>

<p>In the schists of the shear zones, as at the south range,
the thin sections show that the original quartz grains were
small; interstitial material was present, and mica has developed
more largely than in the quartzite. However, in the most
crystalline phases, the fragmental cores of the quartz grains
and their frequent enlargements are plainly seen. Thus the
shearing has not been sufficient to produce a completely
crystalline schist, although this would not be macroscopically
discovered, unless it were suspected because the rock is not
thinly foliated.</p>

<p>As the dip of the quartzite is so steep at this locality, it
is difficult to say how far the shifting of the beds over one
another lessens the apparent thickness. The shear zones as well
as the friction conglomerates appear to be parallel to the bedding.
If they are exactly so, this shearing action would necessitate
an estimate of the original thickness greater than now
shown, since the shear zones probably have less width at the
present time than the beds from which they were originally produced.</p>

<p>Cutting the bedding are heavy joints inclined to the north at
an angle of 20° to 30°. If slipping had occurred along these in
the right direction, this might cause a small thickness of beds to
have a great apparent thickness. However, the schists above
described weather out on the face of the cliffs, and are therefore
marked by recessions in the walls. If slipping parallel to the
jointing had occurred since the schists were formed, these depressions
ought not to match on opposite sides of the joints;
but, on the contrary, they continue unbroken from foot to top,
and probably the joints were formed simultaneously with or later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
than the belts of schist. Consequently, at the upper narrows of
the Baraboo no evidence was found of faulting which could
reduce the estimated thickness of the quartzite as given by
Irving.</p>

<p>As Irving clearly saw, bearing strongly in favor of the theory
of a great fold, is the increasing steeper dip of the layers in
passing north. The phenomena of movement and metamorphism
corresponding so exactly to those required by a simple fold, the
question may be asked if these are not evidence of some weight
in favor of the general correctness of Irving’s conclusion as to
the structure. Had monoclinal faulting extensively occurred, it
would not have been necessary to have had so great a readjustment
of the beds as has been shown to occur by the schists,
cleavage, and the exceedingly intricate macro-fracturing and
micro-fracturing of the rock beds and their constituent particles.</p>

<p>In addition to the phenomena described by Irving,
in summary, the Baraboo quartzite ranges show results of
dynamic metamorphism as follows: A fine example of the
Reibungs Breccia may be seen. A fault zone of limited throw
exists. All phases are exhibited, between a massive quartzite,
showing macroscopically little evidence of interior movement
through a rock exhibiting in turn fracture and cleavage, to a
rock which macroscopically is apparently a crystalline schist.
The foliation of the schists is parallel to the original stratification,
being consequent upon the movements of the beds over
one another, readjustments occurring mainly in the softer layers.
In thin sections the schists still give clear evidence of their
fragmental origin, but also show the mechanical effects of
interior movement. These same effects are apparent within the
heavy beds of quartzite, some readjustment of the particles to
their new positions being here also necessary. There is no evidence
that the semi-crystalline character of the schist and
quartzite are due to high heat. Nowhere are the particles fused.
So far as they are destroyed it is by fracture, and the rock is
again healed by cementation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
The rock, in its most altered condition being a semi-crystalline
schist, and in other parts showing less change, can be connected
with its original state. Had the folding been more
intense, it is reasonable to suppose that the entire rock would
have been transformed into a completely crystalline quartz-schist,
showing no evidence of clastic origin, and possibly the
foliation throughout would have corresponded to the original
bedding.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CHEMICAL_RELATION_OF_IRON_AND_MANGANESE">THE CHEMICAL RELATION OF IRON AND MANGANESE
IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Iron and manganese are frequent constituents of sedimentary
rocks, in some places occurring finely disseminated through
sandstones and shales, or forming a part of limestones, in other
places forming the mass of the deposit in which they occur.
They are both derived primarily from similar, and often from the
same sources, and are in many respects alike in their chemical
behavior in nature. For these reasons it is to be expected that
they would frequently, if not generally, be deposited in intimate
association. Such is found to be the case, and iron and manganese
are often closely associated in the same deposits. Very
often, however, iron and manganese deposits occur close together,
but distinctly separated, while sometimes extensive deposits of
iron, and less commonly of manganese, occur with little or almost
no association with each other.</p>

<p>It is the object of the present paper to discuss the agencies
which are instrumental in causing these substances to be deposited
sometimes together and at other times separately. The
subject is of interest as showing how slight differences in the
chemical behavior of their salts may cause the almost complete
separation of metals once intimately associated.</p>

<h3>THE CONNECTION OF IRON AND MANGANESE IN NATURE.</h3>

<p>A few words concerning the relation of manganese to iron in
nature will perhaps make the following discussion clearer. One
of the most common modes of occurrence of manganese is with
iron, though extensive deposits containing manganese more or
less free from iron often occur. When associated with iron,
manganese occurs with it in various ways. Sometimes the two are
intimately mixed, so that they have the appearance of a homogeneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
mass, resembling iron ore when iron is in the preponderance
and manganese ore when manganese predominates. In such
cases there appears to be no tendency to combine in one fixed proportion,
though, as iron is a much more abundant substance than
manganese, the mixture most commonly contains an excess of
iron, and exists in the form of a manganiferous iron ore. The
manganese, when not intimately mixed with the iron, may occur
in it in pockets or as scattered nodules and concretions. Such
occurrences as those described are frequent in the Lake Superior
iron region, the Appalachian Valley of the eastern states, in
Nova Scotia, Arkansas, Colorado, New Mexico and innumerable
other places. In Virginia very common occurrences are alternating
layers of iron and manganese ore. The iron in such cases is
generally in the larger quantities and the more continuous
deposits; while the manganese is often represented by thin lenticular
layers or by bands of nodules.</p>

<p>From such cases, where iron predominates, there are all
gradations in admixture, up to the rarer cases where manganese
predominates. Frequently a given geologic horizon is characterized
by both iron and manganese, though in one case it may
contain only iron, in another only manganese, and in still another
iron and manganese mixed in various proportions. A remarkable
case of this is seen in the iron and manganese horizons immediately
above, or a short distance above, the Paleozoic quartzite,
on the east side of the Appalachian Valley, especially in the
Valley of Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Here deposits of iron ore, of manganese
ore, and of both ores mixed, are found at various points along
the same geologic horizons. Similar alternations also occur in the
Lower Silurian novaculites of the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
in Cebolla Valley, in Gunnison county, Colorado,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
many other places. In many cases certain horizons are characterized
over large areas by iron alone, and but little manganese, as
is well seen in the Clinton formation and in the Tertiary iron-ore
horizons of Arkansas and Texas; while, on the other hand, some
areas of certain horizons contain considerable quantities of manganese
and very little iron, as is seen in parts of the Marine
limestone in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and also in parts
of the metamorphosed Cretaceous shales of California.</p>

<h3>THE SOURCE OF IRON AND MANGANESE IN SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.</h3>

<p>The iron and manganese contained in sedimentary strata may
be considered as derived primarily from the decay of pre-existing
rocks. Some of the later sedimentary rocks may have
derived a part or all of their iron from older sedimentary rocks,
which, in turn, had derived their iron and manganese from
still older rocks. In this way the iron and manganese in a
given geologic horizon may have formed a part of various older
horizons before they reached their present resting place, but, in
every case, their primary source can be traced back to the original
materials from which sedimentary rocks were first formed. In
certain cases the sea water has supplied a certain amount of iron
and manganese to sedimentary rocks, but in such cases the sea
water acts only as a carrier of these materials from the land
areas or from submarine sources to the strata then forming.</p>

<h3>THE TRANSPORTATION OF IRON AND MANGANESE IN NATURE.</h3>

<p>The process that goes on in this interchange of iron and
manganese from older to younger rocks is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) The conversion, by surface agencies, of the minerals containing
iron and manganese into forms that can be taken into
solution by surface waters.</p>

<p>(2) The solution of the iron and manganese in surface
waters, acidulated with organic and sometimes inorganic acids,
and their transportation in this form from the areas of older
rocks to areas over which younger rocks are being deposited.</p>

<p>(3) Finally, the precipitation in one or more of several ways
of the iron and manganese contained in solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
The iron and manganese thus chemically precipitated may be
deposited either with mechanical sediments, such as sand, clay
etc., or without them. If the deposition of mechanical sediments
is largely in excess of the precipitation of iron and manganese,
the final products will be beds of ferruginous shale,
sandstone, etc., common in many geologic horizons. If the precipitation
of iron and manganese is in excess of the deposition
of mechanical sediments, the resulting products are deposits of
more or less pure iron and manganese ore. Between these two
extremes there are all gradations in the admixture of the iron
and manganese with mechanical sediments.</p>

<p>Frequently the iron and manganese which were originally
finely disseminated through shale, sandstone, etc., are subsequently
concentrated into bodies of comparatively pure ore, and
very commonly this concentration takes place by a process of
re-solution of the iron and manganese and re-deposition by
replacement with limestone, or, more rarely, with some other
material. The limestone or other material which thus acts as a
precipitant is often in the same series of strata from which the
iron and manganese were removed, and thus these two substances,
which were once in a finely disseminated condition, may
be converted into deposits of comparatively pure ore and yet
remain in the same general series of strata in which they were
originally deposited. A remarkable case of this is seen in the iron
deposits of the Penokee series in Michigan and Wisconsin,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> to be
mentioned again on page 370. It has also been suggested by
H. D. Rogers<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> that certain siderite deposits in the Coal Measures
were formed by the conversion of finely disseminated sesquioxide
of iron into carbonate of iron by organic matter, and
the subsequent segregation of the carbonate as now found in
layers and nodules.</p>

<p>The surface waters that carry the iron and manganese to the
strata being deposited at a given time are sometimes derived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
from areas in which iron predominates, sometimes from areas in
which iron and manganese are both abundant, and sometimes,
though rarely, on account of the scarcity of such regions, from
areas in which manganese largely predominates over iron. If
iron and manganese were always precipitated from these waters
in similar chemical forms and under the same conditions, it
would be expected that the strata deriving their iron and manganese
from surface waters would contain those substances in
the same relative proportions as they had existed in the rocks
from which they were derived, and that they would be in an
intimately mixed condition. Such is doubtless often the case,
or at least approximately so; but it is also often the case that
iron and manganese occur in separate deposits, yet in close proximity
to each other and often alternating along the same horizon.
Besides this, the two substances frequently form parts of the
same deposit and yet are distinctly separate from each other. In
such cases the question arises as to why the iron and manganese
are not intimately mixed in the form of a manganiferous iron
ore, as would be expected if they had been precipitated together.
Moreover, deposits sometimes occur which are composed largely
of manganese ore, with little or almost no iron, and when the
source of the manganese is looked for, we often find that the
rocks which probably supplied it contained both manganese and
iron, and that the iron was present in a much larger proportion
as regards the manganese than in the new deposit. Here again
the question arises as to why the iron and manganese are not in
the same relative proportions in the new deposit as they were
in the rocks from which they were derived.</p>

<p>Four principal causes suggest themselves in explanation of
this separation:</p>

<p>(1) It might be supposed that the deposits containing mostly
iron and those containing mostly manganese received these constituents
from waters derived from different sources, and carrying
iron and manganese only in the proportions in which they deposited
them. Under some conditions this explanation might suffice,
but in many cases, such as when iron and manganese alternate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
along the same geologic horizon, and yet in close proximity with
each other, the explanation is entirely inadequate, for the deposits
are too close to each other to have been formed from different
supplies of surface waters.</p>

<p>(2) It might be supposed that the iron or the manganese
had been leached out of a deposit of the mixed ores, leaving
one free from the other and depositing the dissolved ore somewhere
else. This explanation, except in special cases, also
appears inadequate, because the reagents in surface waters, which
dissolve iron and manganese, seem to affect both about equally,
so that if one were dissolved, the other should be taken up in the
same way. Doubtless small differences could be found in the
behavior of the organic and inorganic compounds in surface
waters towards iron and manganese minerals, but they would be
small as compared with the more active reactions which go on.</p>

<p>(3) It might be supposed that a separation could be produced
by secondary concentration such as segregation, replacement, etc.
This has doubtless sometimes been the case, but where the concentrating
action is not assisted by a difference in the chemical
behavior of the two substances, the separation would only be
on a small scale. Even in the case of concentration by replacement
of limestone, if iron and manganese both acted in the same
way during the replacement, it would be expected to find them
deposited in an intimate mixture. Though this secondary concentration,
therefore, unassisted by other agencies, would not
produce all the results found in nature, yet, when it is thus
assisted, it often plays an important part.</p>

<p>(4) The fourth, and what seems the most important, factor
in the separation of iron and manganese, is that, though very
often they are precipitated in the same form from the same
solution, yet sometimes they are precipitated in different forms;
and even when precipitated in the same form, the precipitation
of one sometimes requires different conditions from the precipitation
of the other. This fact will explain the alternate association
and separation of iron and manganese, not only when no
secondary concentration has gone on, but also in cases where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
such concentration has taken place, such as in the replacement
of limestone, etc.</p>

<p>It will now be attempted to show how the various degrees of
association and separation of iron and manganese found in nature
may be produced by different conditions during deposition.</p>

<h3>THE FORMS OF IRON AND MANGANESE DEPOSITED AT ORDINARY
TEMPERATURES.</h3>

<p>The mineralogical forms in which iron and manganese are
deposited from solution in nature at ordinary temperatures
depend on the conditions of air and water, whether of an oxidizing
or a reducing nature, and on the character of the associated
organic and inorganic matter either in solution or on the floor
of the sea, lagoon or bog in which the deposition occurs.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
There are four principal methods by which iron and manganese
are precipitated in nature from surface waters:</p>

<p>(1) By oxidation, as in the case of the precipitation of
hydrous oxides and in the precipitation of the carbonate by the
partial oxidation of more complex organic salts.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>(2) By reduction, as in the precipitation of sulphide of iron
by the reduction of sulphate of iron.</p>

<p>(3) By gaseous or soluble precipitants, as in the precipitation
of sulphide of iron by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen
or a soluble sulphide on a soluble salt of iron, and as in other
cases to be mentioned later.</p>

<p>(4) By replacement of carbonate of lime or some other
substance. Different forms are precipitated by these different
methods.</p>

<p>Iron at ordinary temperatures is usually deposited from solution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
as the hydrous sesquioxide, the carbonate, the sulphide or
the hydrous silicate of iron and potash known as glauconite.
Manganese under similar conditions is deposited as the hydrous
oxide<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> or as the carbonate, and possibly sometimes, though
very rarely, as sulphide.</p>

<p>When solutions of organic or inorganic salts of iron and manganese
are freely exposed to the action of air, as in shallow or
rapidly moving streams, or in lakes and some bogs, they are
quickly oxidized and both may be deposited as more or less
hydrous oxides. In many bogs, however, the metals may be
precipitated as hydrous oxide on the surface where oxidizing
agencies predominate, but when these oxides sink and come into
contact with decaying organic matter, free from the active oxidizing
influences of the air, they may be reduced to carbonates.</p>

<p>The carbonates of iron and manganese may be precipitated
when the solutions containing them are protected from oxidation
by a reducing agent, such as decaying organic matter, or
by being far removed from the air. Carbonate of manganese,
however, is a much more stable compound than carbonate
of iron, and the oxidizing conditions are often sufficiently
strong to cause the deposition of iron as hydrous sesquioxide
and not strong enough to change the manganese from
its carbonate form. It is not uncommon, therefore, to have iron
deposited in one place as hydrous sesquioxide, and manganese
carried further on and deposited as carbonate, or even under
special conditions deposited as carbonate with the hydrous sesquioxide
of iron. Fresenius<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> has shown that the warm springs
of Wiesbaden, which contain iron and manganese among their
other mineral constituents, deposit iron in the form of hydrous
sesquioxide, while manganese is carried on further in solution and
deposited as carbonate. In this behavior, therefore, we have
the first striking difference in the deposition of iron and manganese,
and it will be further discussed later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
The sulphides of iron and manganese differ very much in
their nature and mode of occurrence. Iron is frequently
deposited as sulphide, but manganese rarely occurs in that form,
and when it does it is always in very small quantities. Iron
forms several sulphides in nature: pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>), marcasite
(FeS<sub>2</sub>),<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> pyrrhotite (Fe<sub>11</sub>S<sub>12</sub>), troilite (FeS) and numerous
other more complex compounds unnecessary to enumerate here.
Pyrite is the commonest form of iron sulphide, and occurs in
rocks of all ages, from Archean to Recent. It is formed in
nature by the action of soluble sulphides or sulphuretted hydrogen
on soluble salts of iron, and also by the reduction of
sulphate of iron by organic matter or other reducing agents.
Manganese forms two<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> sulphides, alabandite (MnS) and hauerite
(MnS<sub>2</sub>). Both minerals are very rare, and so unstable that
they rapidly oxidize on exposure. Alabandite is the less rare
form, and usually occurs as a subordinate constituent of certain
metalliferous veins or allied deposits.</p>

<p>Though the sulphides of manganese are easily oxidized, they
are not so unstable that, had they ever been formed in considerable
quantities in sedimentary deposits, they would, even at considerable
depths, have left no trace of their former presence.
Moreover, the sulphide of manganese, as produced artificially,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> is
soluble in certain organic acids, notably acetic, and, as the conditions
for the deposition of sulphides of metals in sedimentary
deposits generally require the presence of organic matter, it is
not improbable that some of the acids given off by such matter
would be capable of dissolving sulphide of manganese. Here,
then, is one reason why manganese might not be deposited as
sulphide under some conditions which would cause the precipitation
of sulphide of iron. Moreover, the artificial formation of
sulphide of manganese (alabandite) in the laboratory is brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
about most easily at high temperatures. It has also been noted
that when manganese, in the form of the alloys spiegeleisen
and ferro-manganese, is added to molten steel, it bodily removes
a part of the sulphur; and it is thought by some metallurgists,
that sulphide of manganese is formed and carried into the slag.</p>

<p>These and other indications of the more easy transition of manganese
into the form of sulphide at high rather than at low temperatures
afford another cause which might prevent sulphide of
manganese from being formed in sedimentary deposits, for such
deposits are usually laid down at ordinary temperatures. On the
other hand, they also afford a cause which might lead to the
deposition of the sulphide of manganese in certain metalliferous
veins and other deposits, where the temperature at the time of
deposition may have been high.</p>

<p>In many of the silver and lead deposits of the Rocky Mountains
manganese oxides occur with the superficial oxidation products
of the sulphides of other metals, and it has often been
suggested that the manganese also was originally in the form of
sulphide. This may be true in some cases, for alabandite has
been found in a few metalliferous deposits in Colorado, Mexico,
Germany, Peru and elsewhere, but in most cases, at least in the
Rocky Mountains, when the level is reached at which the
oxidized forms of lead, zinc, iron and other metals pass into
sulphides, the manganese passes into carbonate or silicate, and
remains in one or both of those forms to all depths that have
been reached.</p>

<p>In the deposition of iron and manganese as sulphide, therefore,
there is a most marked difference of behavior, and here again is
a good cause for the separation of the two substances in sedimentary
rocks, as will be more fully explained below.</p>

<p>Iron is often deposited in sedimentary formations as the
hydrous silicate of iron and potash known as glauconite, and
composes the mass of the large greensand beds common in Cretaceous
and Tertiary strata; but manganese is not found in an
exactly similar condition.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Here again, therefore, is an important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
difference in the modes of deposition of iron and manganese,
which also will be mentioned again.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that while some of the forms in which
iron and manganese are deposited are the same, others differ
very widely, and even similar forms are often deposited under
different conditions. It is doubtless to these various forms and
conditions of deposition that the alternate association and separation
of iron and manganese in nature are due.</p>

<h3>CAUSES OF THE ASSOCIATION OF IRON AND MANGANESE.</h3>

<p>The very frequent intimate association of iron and manganese
in sedimentary rocks is what would be expected from a deposition
as oxide or carbonate in basins such as coastal lagoons or bogs,
where the waters moved very slowly, or not at all, for under
such conditions, they are often deposited together.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Moreover, it
is a well-known fact that isomorphous substances have a strong
tendency to combine in a homogeneous mass, and to crystallize
together in different proportions. Carbonate of iron and of manganese
are isomorphous with each other, and this is hence a
possible cause of the frequent intimacy of their association, such
as is seen in almost all manganiferous spathic iron ores, whether
these ores are formed by direct precipitation or by replacement of
carbonate of lime. The oxidation of such a mixture would give
the common form of an intimately combined iron and manganese
ore.</p>

<p>Since there is usually more iron than manganese in the rocks
from which both metals were originally derived, the surface
waters draining from areas of such rocks usually contain the
metals in a similar proportion. Hence, in cases where the deposition
of the carbonates of both occurs at the same spot, the
isomorphous carbonates derived from the solutions have a larger
percentage of carbonate of iron than of carbonate of manganese,
and the resulting oxides contain the two metals in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
proportion, thus giving rise to the common low-manganese iron
ores.</p>

<p>The hydrous oxides of iron and manganese, however, are not
isomorphous,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and, therefore, when they are precipitated together,
as in bog-deposits, the association is often much less intimate
than in the cases just mentioned, and is simply due to the fact
that, under certain conditions, the oxides of both metals are precipitated
in the same place.</p>

<h3>CAUSES OF THE SEPARATION OF IRON AND MANGANESE.</h3>

<p>When iron and manganese ores occur in more or less separate
deposits, it becomes necessary to suppose the action of influences
different from those which cause the deposition of both together,
and such influences are to be found in the different modes of precipitation,
under certain conditions, of the two metals. It has
been shown by Fresenius<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> that certain warm springs, on reaching
the surface, first deposit hydrous sesquioxide of iron, and farther
on carbonate of manganese. This not only points to the well-known
fact that carbonate of iron is more easily oxidized than
carbonate of manganese, but it also leads to the belief that the
bicarbonate or other salt of iron in the water is more easily oxidized
than the manganese salt.</p>

<p>An action somewhat similar to that described by Fresenius
readily explains the occurrence of manganese sometimes in
entirely separate deposits, sometimes in distinct but closely alternating
deposits.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Under certain conditions, if the waters from
which the precipitation took place were moving, the iron and
manganese, owing to the difference in oxidability, as stated above,
would be laid down in different places, resulting in the formation
of deposits of iron ore free from manganese, and manganese ore
free from iron in different positions along the plane of the same
geologic horizon. Such occurrences are often seen in the iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
regions of the Appalachian Valley, where there are often found,
in different places along the same belt, deposits of iron ore
and deposits of manganese ore in positions similar with relation
to the enclosing rocks.</p>

<p>These conditions of moving water might also cause the occurrence
of the two ores in interstratified layers, as is sometimes the
case. Such a condition would result if iron were deposited in a
certain place at one time, and if, later, on account of some
increased facility for oxidation, iron was deposited before it
reached that place, and the manganese, being less easily precipitated,
were carried on and laid down upon the first deposit of iron.</p>

<p>Suppose the metalliferous solutions to be confined in a shallow
basin, or, at least, to pass through it so slowly that they become
thoroughly oxidized. Under such conditions the deposition
of iron and manganese would go on continuously, and so nearly
on the same spot that a comparatively homogeneous manganiferous
iron ore would be formed. If the supply of metalliferous
solutions were not continuous, but were intermittent, as is sometimes
the case in local basins, such as coastal lagoons, which are
often dependent for their supply of water on the changes of
season and the sudden fluctuations of weather, then interstratified
layers of iron and manganese ore might be produced. The iron,
becoming oxidized on the surface, sinks to the bottom, possibly
in some cases to be converted there to the simple carbonate by
organic matter. Further oxidation precipitates hydrous oxide or
carbonate of manganese on top of the iron. A renewed supply of
surface waters brings more solutions of iron and manganese, or
else the evaporation of the water in the closed basin concentrates
the materials which have not yet been precipitated. In either
case there is a further alternate deposition of the two ores.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Another process of separation of iron and manganese in nature
might take place by the formation of sulphide of iron. It
has already been shown that iron is sometimes deposited as sulphide
and later oxidized in the same manner as the carbonate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
Manganese, on the other hand, is rarely found as sulphide, and
there is reason to think that the sulphide never represented the
original form of any large sedimentary deposits of manganese ore
(see pages 364 to 365). It seems probable, therefore, that from
a solution of iron and manganese in surface waters the iron might,
where the conditions are favorable, be precipitated as sulphide
(FeS<sub>2</sub>) and the manganese might be carried on in solution to be
deposited somewhere else as oxide or carbonate. Subsequently
the oxidation of the ores would give rise to oxide of iron from
the sulphide and oxide of manganese from the carbonate; and
the two ores, though occurring at the same horizon, would be
separated by a greater or less distance.</p>

<p>After the deposition of the sulphide of iron, the conditions
might change and permit the deposition, in the same place, of
the carbonates of iron and manganese together. This is an easy
case to imagine, and where such a deposit was exposed to surface
influences, the resulting product would be oxide of iron from
the underlying sulphide and a manganiferous iron oxide from the
overlying isomorphous carbonates. Hence another possible cause
of the frequent association of pure iron ores and manganiferous
iron ores. It is possible also that after the solution of iron and
manganese had been freed from the former by precipitation as
sulphide, the manganese might be carried on and laid down as
carbonate on a previous deposit of iron sulphide, and when such
a combination was oxidized, the result would be oxide of iron
and oxide of manganese in beds closely associated but yet distinct.</p>

<p>By supposing the iron sometimes to be deposited in sea water
as glauconite, a manner in which manganese is not laid down (see
page 365), a further means of separation of the two metals would
result.</p>

<p>Thus by alternating the conditions of the deposition of iron
and manganese in different forms, a great variety of methods of
association and separation of the two metals can be produced.</p>

<p>The above discussion refers not only to the deposits of iron
and manganese ores of notable size, but also to the iron and manganese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
frequently found disseminated through shales, sandstones
etc. In these rocks they usually form a small but often a very
important part, for in many cases the iron and manganese is taken
into solution from the rocks and redeposited by a process of replacement
with carbonate of lime in neighboring beds of
limestone, or more rarely by replacement with other rocks, thus
giving rise to important ore deposits. The question of the association
and separation of the iron and manganese in these replacement
deposits depends on a number of conditions, the principal
of which are, just as in the class of deposits that has been discussed,
the conditions during deposition and the forms in which
the iron and manganese are precipitated. The processes by which
association and separation occur in replacement deposits differ
somewhat in detail from the processes just discussed, but are
based on the same principles.</p>

<p>Many of the iron and manganese deposits of the Appalachian
region are supposed by many to be replacement deposits. N. S.
Shaler<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> in 1877 suggested that some of the iron deposits of
Kentucky and Ohio were formed by the solution of iron from
certain rocks, and its deposition in the form of carbonates by
replacement with underlying limestone. Subsequently it was
changed by oxidation to brown hematite. A notable case
of replacement has also been shown by R. D. Irving and
C. R. Van Hise<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> in the iron deposits of the Penokee series of
Michigan and Wisconsin. Here the ore is supposed to be
partly a replacement of chert in a trough between quartzite
and igneous rocks. The solution that contained the iron
was derived from strata in the same series of rocks in which
the iron was re-deposited and contained a certain amount
of manganese. It is shown how the iron and manganese were
more or less separated in the replacement process and that the
separation was due to the difference in the oxidability of the carbonates
as explained on page 363.</p>

<p><i>Introduction.</i> In order to study intelligently the history of a
river, one must first become acquainted with the present physical
geography of the region in which the river lies, and know
the stages of its development. Therefore, before classifying the
rivers of Connecticut, I shall consider the topography of the
state, and in a few paragraphs outline the successive cycles in
the history of its growth. The scope of this article will not permit
a discussion or even a full statement of the evidence on
which these conclusions are based. They have been stated at
considerable length by Professor W. M. Davis,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and the reader
is referred to his papers for the complete discussion. His conclusions
in respect to the physical geography are accepted here
without question, and form the basis for the discussion on the
rivers of the state.</p>

<p><i>Topography of Connecticut.</i> Connecticut can be said to consist
of two great areas quite distinct in topography and geologic
structure.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> On the east and on the west are the crystalline
uplands which rise from sea level along the Sound to 1,700 and
1,800 feet in the northwestern part of the state, and to 600
and 700 feet in the northeastern. These uplands consist chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
of gneiss and granite, probably of pre-Paleozoic age, which are
now much folded, faulted and crumpled. Between these two
areas of crystallines is a lowland belt of Triassic sandstone and
shale, twenty to twenty-five miles wide, extending from New
Haven north through the center of the state and including in its
borders New Haven, Meriden, Hartford, New Britain and many
towns of lesser note. These sandstones form a monocline with
an eastward dip of 10° to 30°, and in addition to being tilted they
have been faulted since their deposition in a shallow, slowly-subsiding
trough of crystallines. Their thickness is variously
estimated—3,000 to 5,000 feet, Dana; 10,000 or more, Davis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
This lowland is interrupted by a series of trap ridges, which in
general present steep faces toward the west, whereas their eastward
slope is gradual, less than the dip of the sandstones.</p>

<p><i>The upland plateau.</i> Suppose we ascend the highest point
of these trap ridges, the old tower on Talcott Mt., nine miles
west of Hartford; we are 900 feet above the sea level and more
than 600 above the plain at our feet. A few miles to the west
across the sandstone valley, rise the crystalline uplands, which
extend far to the north and to the south. On the east across the
Connecticut we see the eastern uplands. The first impression,
which comes to one as he gazes upon these uplands and which
is strengthened with each view, is that few hills rise above the
general level of the plateau; the crest line is nearly horizontal,
declining gently to Long Island Sound. Above this general
level are a few rounded domes, but no sharp, towering peaks.
Below it valleys have been cut, but they do not destroy the
plateau-like appearance. A view from the western plateau
across the sandstone valley shows the remarkably even crest
line of the trap ridges, a crest line which approximates in height
the uplands on the east and west. A nearer view of the upland
corroborates our first impressions of the gently rolling character
of the inter-stream surfaces, but we have a better view of the
valleys which have been sunk beneath the general level and of the
low rounded hills which rise above it. In popular parlance the
country is “hilly.” It is uneven, not because there are high hills,
but rather because there are deep valleys. If in imagination we
fill up these valleys and the wide Triassic lowland to the general
level of the broad inter-stream surfaces, we shall have constructed
a gently undulating plateau, dipping to the south and
east—a peneplain.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p><i>Origin of the peneplain.</i> This is not a constructional surface,
for the rocks are greatly tilted, folded and faulted, so that the
surface consequent upon such disturbance must have been complex
and mountainous. Long subaërial denudation upon a
folded and faulted mass when the land stood much lower than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
at present produced this plateau. Evidently it could be produced
by denudation only at or near baselevel, for the effect of
erosion upon a mass high above baselevel is to accentuate its
topographic relief, not to reduce it. We naturally ask ourselves,
“At what stage in geologic history did this denudation occur?”</p>

<p><i>Date of the peneplain.</i> The erosion which accomplished this
great work must have commenced after the formation and dislocation
of the Triassic beds, for the even crest line of the trap
ridges, a part of which—perhaps all—were contemporaneous
with the sandstones, is a part of the dissected peneplain; but to
fix the date of the completion of the peneplain, we must turn to
evidence presented in New Jersey.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> There we learn that by the
close of Cretaceous times, the country was eroded nearly to baselevel,
and we may therefore speak of the relative position of the
land and sea, to which the land was at this time reduced, as the
Cretaceous baselevel, and this land surface as the Cretaceous
peneplain.</p>

<p><i>Elevation of the peneplain.</i> In post-Cretaceous, presumably
early Tertiary<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> times, the land was elevated to nearly its present
height and remained at that altitude, so far as topographic
evidence shows, during Tertiary times. The proofs of this elevation
are the valleys which the streams have sunk below the
general level. That this was not a simple uplift, but was accompanied
with tilting and warping, is clear from the following considerations.
The depth to which a stream can cut its valley
depends directly upon its height above baselevel. If the present
surface were a peneplain uniformly elevated, the head waters
and middle courses of a river would not be cut so deep in the
surrounding plain as its lower course. But the reverse is true
of the rivers of Connecticut. The depth of the valley increases
inland, being greater in those regions where the peneplain was
raised the highest. A comparison of the upper and lower valleys
of the Housatonic, Naugatuck, Quinnebaug, and of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
Connecticut at Middletown, where it enters the plateau,
and at its mouth, will give some idea of the amount of
the warping. It will not give an <em>exact measure</em> of it for several
reasons: first, the upper courses of the rivers have not yet
reached the present baselevel; second, the present altitude of
the uplands is the result of the post-Cretaceous uplift and warping,
plus a probable later post-Tertiary uplift (to be mentioned
later), besides several minor oscillations, the last of which was
downward, and is recorded near the coast in the drowned condition
of the rivers. As has been already said, the peneplain is
highest in the northwest, and gradually declines to sea level
toward the south and east.</p>

<p><i>Consequences of the uplift.</i> The consequences of this uplift
are seen in the valleys, which are cut into the peneplain, and
which have destroyed the level character of the country. In
the hard crystalline rocks the valleys are generally narrow and
deep, with bold slopes;<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> where they are cut in the crystalline
limestone, they are wider and more open. In marked contrast,
however, is the lowland on the Triassic area in which only the
trap ridges remain to tell of the former altitude of the general
surface, and the immense amount of erosion which has taken
place on the soft sandstones and shales. Indeed erosion has
progressed so rapidly on these soft rocks, that they have been
worn down almost to a new baselevel in the same length of time
in which the hard crystallines have been only trenched. This fact
cannot be too strongly emphasized. The broad sandstone lowland
from New Haven north into Massachusetts has been carved
out of the uplifted peneplain in soft rocks, during the same time in
which the Connecticut has excavated its gorge in the crystallines
below Middletown, and the Housatonic has opened its upland
valley on the limestones. The difference in results is due not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
a difference of time, but to the difference in the relative hardness
of the rocks.</p>

<p>On the basis of this principle the age of certain river gorges
to which reference will be made later can be fixed. The <em>narrow</em>
passage of the Quinnipiac through a sandstone ridge southwest
of Meriden cannot belong to the same cycle of erosion as the
<em>broad sandstone lowland</em> on either side of it, but manifestly must
be much younger. So, also, the narrow passage of the Farmington
at Tariffville, where it crosses the trap ridge through a
gorge free from drift, is of much later date than the <em>broader</em> valley
more or less encumbered with drift which the upper part of the
same river has cut in the hard crystalline schists. Cook’s Gap in
the trap sheet west of New Britain is much broader than either of
the above, and belongs to the Tertiary cycle of erosion, although
as I shall endeavor to show later, it was probably not occupied
by a stream during the whole cycle. In marked contrast, also,
with the Tariffville gorge is the gap by which the Westfield river
in Massachusetts cuts the trap ridge. This gap was formerly
broad and open—the result of Tertiary erosion—but is now filled
with drift, in which the river is at present working. Since these
two rivers are essentially the same in size, are now at the same
level, and the rock is the same in both cases, the only explanation
for the difference in the two passages is that they belong
to different cycles.</p>

<p>To recapitulate, the results of the post-Cretaceous uplift are
seen in the valleys which have been cut in the peneplain. The
narrow valleys in the gneisses and schists, the upland valleys in
the limestones, the wide open, drift encumbered gaps in the trap
ridge,—Cook’s and the Westfield river gaps,—the broad open
lowland on the sandstones, are all the result of erosion in this
cycle. The Quinnipiac gorge in the sandstone, and the Tariffville
gorge in the trap are just as surely of a later date. They
do not at all accord with the work of the earlier cycle either in
size, angle of slope, or depth.</p>

<p>This conclusion is somewhat at variance with an opinion
expressed by Professor J. D. Dana,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> but it seems justifiable in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
view of the successive cycles in the physical development of the
region. In another part of this article I shall consider these
gaps again in connection with their river histories, and shall give
additional reasons why I venture to differ from so eminent an
authority.</p>

<p><i>Length of this cycle.</i> This cycle of erosion beginning with
the post-Cretaceous uplift was not so long as the preceding cycle.
In the earlier one the whole state was reduced to a peneplain; in
the later cycle only the soft Triassic sandstones were brought near
to baselevel. It probably lasted through Tertiary times, and was
brought to a close by a slight uplift. The result of this uplift
is well shown in Pennsylvania<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and New Jersey.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> It is not well
shown in Connecticut, but there seem to be some traces of it in
the trenches the rivers have cut below the level of the sandstone
peneplain. However, these trenches are so much obscured by
drift that a positive statement is not warranted. It may, however,
be spoken of provisionally as the post-Tertiary uplift.
There may have been later oscillations of small amount, probably
were; here and there are shreds of evidence which point to such
oscillations, but only one movement has had an effect upon the
topography, which can be recognized. The fjorded condition of
all the rivers along the Sound—the Norwalk, Saugatuck, New
Haven bay, Niantic and Thames are the best examples—shows
that within comparatively recent time there has been a slight subsidence
of the land. But this movement is not to be compared
in amount with those of the earlier cycles.</p>

<p><i>The drift.</i> Over all the state in varying thickness lies the
glacial drift, either in its typical unmodified development as till,
or in its modified form, as river terraces, kames, eskers and sand-plains.
It is of importance in this connection only as it has
affected the topography of the country and so modified the
drainage. Examples of these modifications will be mentioned
later.</p>

<p><i>Résumé.</i> There was first a long cycle of denudation in pre-Triassic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
times, during which the contorted crystallines were worn
down to a comparative level; second, a cycle of subsidence, deposition
and volcanic outburst, during which the sea entered the
crystalline trough, and the Triassic conglomerates, sandstones and
shales were deposited with the intercalated layers of lava; third,
a long cycle of elevation, folding, faulting and erosion, during
which the sedimentary beds were elevated—tilted into the present
faulted monocline, and this constructional surface worn down to a
baselevel of erosion in late Cretaceous times. Each of these
cycles probably represents the sum total of several subordinate
cycles. There was, fourth, a post-Cretaceous uplift inaugurating
a period of erosion lasting through Tertiary times and resulting
in the formation of valleys in the hardest rocks, and a lowland
approaching baselevel on the Triassic sandstones and shales;
fifth, a probable late or post-Tertiary uplift, when the valleys
were deepened and the lowlands trenched—obscure in Connecticut,
but well shown farther south; sixth, the land, near the
coast at least, is now slightly lower than it has been in the not
remote past, as is shown by the fjords.</p>

<p>With the changes of the physical geography clearly in mind,
the rivers of Connecticut may now be examined in respect to
their conditions of origin, the number of cycles through which
they have lived, and the approach they have made to mature
old age. But at the very outset a serious difficulty is encountered,
for the geological structure of the state is nowhere well described,
nor have topographic maps of all the districts yet been issued.
Since the structural details are to some extent unknown
it is unwise in many cases to attempt more than tentative
conclusions. Several of the problems to be presented cannot
be considered as settled. Considerable progress toward a final
settlement will have been made, however, if the conditions of
the problems are made clear, various hypotheses suggested, and
the attention of workers in this field called to these questions.</p>

<p><i>Early drainage.</i> Of the drainage of Connecticut during
Jurassic and Cretaceous times very little can be said. It is not
even known whether it was consequent upon the Jurassic tilting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
and faulting, or whether these deformations were so slow in their
movement that the rivers persisted in spite of them. It may have
been that the larger rivers were victorious, while the smaller
were conquered and compelled to assume new consequent
courses. Whatever was their origin there must have been
abundant opportunities during the long erosion which resulted in
the Cretaceous baselevel, and again in the period of revived and
quickened degradation succeeding the post-Cretaceous uplift,
for the streams to adjust themselves in a large degree to the
geological structure. The contrast of hard and soft beds and the
great elevation must have been potent factors in bringing to pass
such a result. We expect to find the streams so far re-adjusted
as to render improbable the discovery of their manner of origin.</p>

<p><i>The Housatonic, a re-adjusted stream.</i> The best example of
re-adjustment is found in the northwestern part of the state
where the Housatonic and some of its branches follow well adjusted
courses. From its headwaters, near Pittsfield, Mass., to
New Milford, Conn., it has nearly all the way chosen its course
along the Cambrian crystalline limestones in preference to the
harder granites and gneisses on either side. The stratigraphical
relationships of the limestone are not fully understood, but they
seem to be deeply eroded anticlines and synclines, whose axes
plunge north or south at various angles. The course of the
river, if the drainage was consequent, was at first along the
synclinal valleys, passing from one to another across the lowest
points in the anticlinal ridge between them. But by a series of
changes<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>, resulting from the differential rates of erosion as hard
or soft beds became exposed, the river previously to the Cretaceous
baseleveling, seems to have re-adjusted its course to the softer
limestones. However, there are several places where this conformity
to structure does not seem to be the law; where the
river departs from a limestone valley to flow for a time in the
crystallines, only to return to the limestone again. The most
marked instance of this is in the towns of Sharon and Cornwall,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
where the river leaves the limestone valley, which continues to
the southwest, and flows for ten miles in a narrow gorge in the
gneiss, only to again enter at its northern end a long narrow bed
of limestone. The following seems to be the probable explanation.
When the land stood at the elevation represented by the
Cretaceous peneplain, these hard beds were below or but very
slightly above baselevel, and were therefore undiscovered by the
stream or had just begun to make themselves known late in the
cycle. Had they been reached early in the cycle, when the stream
was far above baselevel and presumably before many of its tributaries
had been developed, and when it was therefore a smaller
river, it is quite probable that further re-adjustments would have
occurred, and the stream been led away from the hard rocks onto
the softer beds to the west; but when they were reached the
stream had cut so deeply and so nearly to baselevel that it was
safe from capture. After the elevation of the peneplain the
stream was revived and disclosed more and more of these hard
beds, but was then, owing to the development and head-water
growth of its tributaries, too important a river to be diverted by
any rival. A river of this kind may be said to be “conformably
superimposed” in distinction to one which is superimposed from
an unconformable cover.</p>

<p><i>Revived streams.</i> It is important to recognize the effect of the
post-Cretaceous uplift upon the rivers at that time established.
As the land was baseleveled and the velocity of the streams decreased,
they lost in large degree their cutting power and
sluggishly meandered more or less in broad flood-plains. During
and for a period after the uplift, their cutting power was restored
to them by virtue of their increased velocity and they excavated
the deep narrow valleys which we find in the crystalline highlands.
The upper course of the Housatonic is a good example
of a river re-adjusted to the structure during one cycle, revived
by uplift to a second cycle of erosion, and in places “conformably
superimposed” upon structures from which it would have
been led away in the ordinary course of re-adjustment. Its
tributaries, the East Aspetuck, Still, Shepaug, and Pomeraug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
follow courses re-adjusted in one cycle and revived in a later
uplift.</p>

<p>We can assert with the more confidence that such was the
history of the upper Housatonic, because we find in other states,
in regions whose history has been the same, similar examples of
“conformably superimposed” and “revived” streams. The Musconetcong
and Pequest, highland rivers of New Jersey, are
streams “revived” from mature old age to vigorous youth
and “conformably superimposed” upon saddles of gneiss between
two limestone valleys.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p><i>Unconformable rivers.</i> In considering the course of the lower
Housatonic we meet with some difficulty at the outset. In
the southern part of the town of New Milford the river leaves
the limestone belt which continues with some slight interruptions
to the Hudson, and swings sharply into the crystalline plateau
in a southeasterly course until it is joined by the Naugatuck,
when their united waters flow south for a few miles to the sound.
The course of the lower Connecticut is even more surprising.
At Middletown it leaves the broad open Triassic sandstone lowland,
and through a gorge enters the plateau, which has an
average elevation of 600 to 700 feet. In this plateau of crystallines
the river has sunk its valley nearly to sea-level. The
slopes are steep compared to the lines in the sandstone lowland,
and the contrast between the two parts of the river is one of
the striking features of Connecticut scenery. Several theories
may be framed to account for the curious behavior of these two
rivers, but none of them are free from all difficulty.</p>

<p><i>As a consequent river.</i> The lower Connecticut has been
thought<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> to be a revived river, whose course was consequent upon
the post-Triassic tilting and faulting. The faulted monocline
seems to have had the shape of a half-boat, ends to the north
and south, and one gunwale rising toward the west, the combined
effect of the tilting and faulting being to swing the river to the
southeast, where the keel of the boat was lowest. The probable
existence of faults, with upthrow on the east, along the eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
margin of the Triassic rocks, is a difficulty in the way of the
complete acceptance of this theory. Unfortunately too little is
known about the structure of the western plateau to say whether
the course of the lower Housatonic could be accounted for on
such an hypothesis. On this theory the Connecticut would be
consequent upon the Jurassic deformation, and revived by the
post-Cretaceous uplift.</p>

<p>It may be suggested that the southeast courses are due to
the tilting of the peneplain at the time of elevation, the plateau
now being, as we have seen, much higher in the northwestern
part of the state than elsewhere. But the acceptance of this
theory necessitates a degree of smoothness and absence of even
mild relief in the peneplain, which is hardly possible. The present
average slope of the plateau is but a few feet per mile, and it
seems incredible that so gentle a tilting could force rivers as
large as these to take new courses. Besides, if the Housatonic
and Connecticut were deflected, why were not the smaller
streams—the Naugatuck and Quinnebaug—also given southeastern
deflections? Clearly, this explanation is not the correct
one.</p>

<p><i>Superimposition.</i> It has been suggested that these courses
may be inherited from a Cretaceous cover, which formerly
stretched over Connecticut for a considerable distance, but of
which no traces now remain in the state. On parts of Long
Island the Cretaceous deposits are found, and it is not inherently
impossible nor improbable that they once stretched far over the
main land. In New Jersey<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> several lines of evidence seem to
show that the Cretaceous beds formerly extended across the Triassic,
probably to the margin of the highland plateau. The
curious drainage of the Watchung Crescent is one evidence of
this, but the other proofs are along entirely different lines, so that
there is apparently good evidence that the Cretaceous beds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
extended twenty-five miles or more farther inland. If, in the
time which has elapsed since the deposition of these beds, there
has been erosion sufficient to strip them off from such a broad
area in New Jersey, may they not, in Connecticut, under presumably
similar conditions, have been equally eroded?</p>

<p>There is much which makes this hypothesis attractive, and,
as the facts were first studied, it seemed the most likely one. It
affords a good explanation, not only for the courses of the
Housatonic and Connecticut, but also for other rivers along the
sound. It seems, also, at first thought, to be well supported by
analogy from New Jersey. But a closer study of the situation
in that state reveals marked differences in the attendant circumstances.
There the soft Triassic sandstone must have been worn
down to a lowland early in the Cretaceous cycle, perhaps by the
close of Jurassic time or thereabouts, while the harder crystallines
retained a strong relief. The slight subsidence, which
marked the beginning of marine Cretaceous in New Jersey,
allowed the Cretaceous sea to transgress rapidly the baseleveled
sandstones to the foot of the crystalline hills, but not to cover
them to any extent. It is not probable that the crystallines in
Connecticut had been brought nearer to baselevel than those in
New Jersey at the time of the Cretaceous deposits. There is no
evidence to show that the subsidence was greater in Connecticut
than in New Jersey, and, therefore, from <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">a priori</i> considerations,
the conclusion would seem to follow that the subsidence, which
permitted the Cretaceous sea to cover the Triassic sandstone area
of New Jersey, was not sufficient to permit the sea to cover the
then unsubdued crystalline hills of Connecticut. Although this
hypothesis is not to be hastily thrown aside, for theoretical reasons,
yet it would seem necessary to hold it very lightly, at least
until some positive proof is found of the former existence of the
Cretaceous or some later formation in that region. The first suggestion,
that the lower Connecticut was a consequent river in the
Cretaceous cycle and was revived by the post-Cretaceous uplift,
is, at the present state of knowledge, the most probable.</p>

<p><i>The Farmington.</i> The roundabout course of this river presents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
another interesting problem, which is not free from difficulties.
From its source in Massachusetts it flows southeast
across the crystallines to the village from which it takes its
name, where it turns abruptly north along the Triassic sandstones
for ten or twelve miles, when with another wide sweep it crosses
the trap ridges at Tariffville by a deep gorge, and resumes its
southeasterly course to the Connecticut. Of this latter part I
will speak later, but now arise the questions, “what has been
the history of this river,” and “why does it turn north at Farmington?”</p>

<p><i>The Farmington in the Tertiary cycle.</i> A course more accordant
with the structure would seem to be south along the Quinnipiac
and Mill river valleys to the sound at New Haven. As has been
said before (page 376), Prof. Dana has expressed the opinion
that the gorge at Tariffville was occupied by the Farmington in
Tertiary times, and that the Westfield river gap further north
and the gorge of the Quinnipiac southwest of Meriden are also of
earlier date than the glacial epoch. One reason has also been given
why I differ from him in regard to the Quinnipiac and Tariffville
gorges—they are narrower and steeper than those made in similar
rocks during the Tertiary cycle. But more than this, the
constructional topography, resulting from the tilting and faulting
of the region, could not, it would seem, have caused the Farmington
to take its present course. Even if it had taken this
roundabout course during the baseleveling of the country, it
must, since it would have had to cross three trap sheets,
have been captured and led to the sea by the shorter and
easier way along the sandstone area. The fact that the Connecticut
probably persisted in its consequent course is no argument
for similar conditions for the Farmington, because the
latter is much the smaller stream, and so more easily captured.
Nor could the river have been forced into this course during or
after the post-Cretaceous uplift, for the land was then raised
more at the north than at the south, and any changes from this
cause would have been to confirm the river in its southward
course. It is very probable, therefore, that in at least the latter
part of the Tertiary cycle, the Farmington did not have its present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
course, but followed the open sandstone valley, along the
course of the Quinnipiac and Mill rivers of to-day. The earlier
history of this river is purely conjectural; one fact may shed a
little light upon it, a fact which may indicate that this course
was an adjusted one taken during Tertiary times.</p>

<p><i>In pre-Tertiary times. Origin of Cook’s Gap.</i> A few miles
southeast of where the river emerges from the crystallines, the
trap ridge is cut by a deep wind notch—Cook’s Gap—through
which the New York and New England Railroad passes west
from New Britain. As was pointed out some time ago by Prof.
Davis,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> this is not a fault gap, because the alignment of the ridge
is not broken, but it is probably an abandoned water gap, the
head-waters of the stream which formerly occupied it having
been abstracted by a rival, which did not have to cross
a hard trap ridge. Perhaps this river was the ancestor of the
present Farmington, and in that case its history would seem to
have been as follows. A stream consequent upon the constructional
topography after the faulting and tilting at the close of
the Triassic, it had its upper course on the crystallines, its lower
on the sandstones and buried trap sheets. In its old age it crossed
by a shallow gap the trap sheet, which had been uncovered by
erosion. In the second or Tertiary cycle it was simply a revived
stream quickened to a new life by the post-Cretaceous uplift of the
peneplain. This uplift gave opportunity to a rival stream, which
did not have to cross the hard trap beds to intercept the waters
of the old Farmington, and lead them out by a shorter, easier
path, probably down the sandstone valley west of the trap
ridge. The path across the trap was abandoned, and the notch
became a wind gap; the river following its new course, until the
incursion of the ice-sheet interrupted its normal development.
This is of course almost entirely speculative. Cook’s Gap is
best explained as an abandoned river gap; the Farmington is the
nearest river of a size proportional to the size of the gap, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
hypothesis is a rational one. There is, however, no direct evidence
that the Farmington once occupied Cook’s Gap.</p>

<p><i>The Tariffville cut.</i> Before attempting to answer the second
question, “why the river flows north at Farmington?” let us consider
for a moment the history of the Tariffville cut. The river
occupies a gorge whose sides are steep and talus covered, but
which is not at all clogged with drift. There is naturally no
room at or near the water level, even for the wagon road, place
for which has been blasted near the top of the gorge. The profile
of the gap shows a gentle ascent from the top of the gorge, up
to the nearly level crest line of the ridge. That is to say, the
recent gorge has been cut in the bottom of a sag in the ridge.
We have already given our reasons for believing that the gorge
here is much younger than the Westfield river gap; that it is a
part of the work of the next cycle; that it is post-Tertiary. The
sag, however, in the bottom of which the gorge is cut, is clearly
of the earlier cycle. The bottom of the sag is much above the
level to which the rivers had cut their valleys in the late Tertiary,
and, therefore, it is certain that a river could not have occupied it
at the close of that cycle. It was probably an abandoned water-gap
whose stream had been captured in the same way and in
the same cycle as the river, which formerly occupied Cook’s
Gap.</p>

<p>The fact that the sag and gorge, although located very near
a fault line, do not correspond to it, but are transverse and independent
of it, is instructive and needs a moment’s attention. It
seems probable that the stream consequent upon the faulted
blocks would have flowed down the slope of the tilted block and
then along the fault line at the foot of the fault cliff and would
have held this course during the baseleveling of the country.
When the area was baseleveled the stream must have swung
from side to side in its broad flood plain, and thus departed from
the fault line. When it was revived by the post-Cretaceous uplift,
it was confined to the course it had unwittingly taken on the
sandstones just above the hard ridge, and it was forced to cut
down through the trap. Subsequently a rival, which did not have
to work against this obstacle, abstracted its head waters and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
gap was abandoned. The accompanying diagrams may make
this easier to understand. <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> is a cross-section of the
faulted monocline, R showing the position of the river along the
foot of the fault cliff. The line B L represents the surface of
the country after baseleveling, the trap outcrops forming <em>low</em>
hills (much exaggerated in the diagram). <a href="#fig3">Figure 4</a> shows the
dislocated trap sheets, the fault line and the winding course of
the river, which has abandoned the fault line except where it
passes between the low trap hills. Here the country is at baselevel.
<a href="#fig3">Figure 5</a> represents the region after the elevation and
resulting erosion. The trap ridges have become more pronounced,
and have migrated eastward in the direction of the
dip. The river has been slowly let down upon the northern one
from the sandstone at point G and has there cut into the solid
trap.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figures 3–5.</span></div></div>

<p>The transverse notch of Cook’s Gap, already described,
was probably located in a somewhat similar manner, but the case
is not so clear as at Tariffville.</p>

<p><i>Gravel terraces of the Farmington.</i> A consideration of some
facts concerning the height and slope of the terraces along this
part of the river may give a clue to the answer to our question.
One-half a mile east of Tariffville and east of the trap ridge, the
highest terrace is 210 to 215 feet. Half a mile south of the
same place but west of the ridge the height is 275 feet.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
top of the gorge at Tariffville is about 190 feet above the sea-level.
It does not seem probable that these highest terraces were ever
continuous over all the Farmington valley. But if they represent
the level reached by the maximum flood accompanying the
melting of the glacier, the great difference in their height
on the two sides of the trap ridge, in connection with
the other evidence already noted, gives strong reason for
believing that the gorge as it exists to-day had not then been
cut. A mile and a half east of Tariffville there is a lower terrace
which is wide-spread. Its general height is about 190 feet,
in places a little more. In this terrace the lower part of the
Farmington has cut a trench 90 to 100 feet deep. The shape
of the valley makes clear the fact that before this trench was cut
the river flowed at about the 190 foot level, which is the height
of the bottom of the sag at Tariffville. On the west side of the
trap ridge there is also a more or less wide-spread terrace at
about the same height. It seems very probable therefore that
the river was raised to the level of the old sag in the trap ridge
by the building of these terraces.</p>

<p>The present average southward slope of the highest terraces
west of the trap ridge from Northampton, Mass., to Farmington,
Conn., forty-four miles, is seven inches per mile,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> and Professor
Dana is inclined to believe that this is approximately the slope
at the time the terraces were built. The character of the
deposits shows that the current which formed these deposits
flowed south. The present river, flowing north, falls twenty feet
between Farmington and Tariffville, or 1⅔ feet per mile. The
reversal of the river was probably determined by two factors.
Near the village of Farmington, the waters of 200 square miles
of territory are poured into the valley by the upper Farmington
and its tributary, the Pequabuck. During the terrace building
stage the great mass of débris contributed by these streams was
deposited where the steep gradient of the highlands was
exchanged for the gentle slope of the lowland. The main north
and south valley was thus choked by the débris of its tributaries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
and a long stretch of comparatively still water extended north
from Farmington, in which nearly horizontal deposits were made.
South of Farmington the terrace deposits are much coarser than
to the north, and the face of the terraces is much greater. It is
not impossible that, as the deposits between Farmington and the
Massachusetts state line approached nearer and nearer to horizontality,
the waters of the upper Farmington began to divide,
part flowing north and part south, the northward flowing portion
finding an outlet at the sag at Tariffville. If this was the case,
the terraces between Farmington and Tariffville must have had
a slight slope to the north. Their present southward slope could
readily be accounted for by the re-elevation of the land after
the disappearance of the ice. This explanation rests upon the
ability of the upper Farmington and the Pequabuck to have
completely dammed the southward flowing current and turned
it northward by the great mass of their deposits. If this was not
the case, and there may be some doubt on the matter, the subsidence
which accompanied the later stages of the ice-retreat is
the other factor in the problem. It is estimated that an average
depression of 1.25 feet<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> through the Connecticut valley would
restore it to an altitude approximating that at the close of glaciation.
It seems highly probable that these terrace-deposits
were built before the maximum depression was reached. If this
was the case, the depression would be efficient in reversing the
Farmington, and this factor would supplement the first. It is
impossible at present to say to what extent these two factors
enter into the problem. That they are not mutually exclusive
is evident, and that they are together quantitatively competent
seems certain. Among the several hypotheses which have been
considered, this seems the most probable, and in the light of the
present evidence the most rational.</p>

<p>At first thought it might seem that if the Farmington was
reversed by the differential subsidence of the land, the Connecticut
ought to have suffered a similar fate, and since it did
not, the explanation cannot apply to the Farmington. But
the terraces of the Connecticut have a much greater southward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
slope than those on the smaller river, and the depression was
not sufficient to reverse the stream. The conditions on the two
sides of the trap ridge were not the same.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, the history of the Farmington seems to
have been as follows: Its original consequent course was southeast
on the crystallines and perhaps across the trap ridge at
Cook’s Gap, from which course it was turned in the Tertiary
cycle by a stream whose course was approximately that of the
Mill river of to-day. The damming of the valley by the deposits
of the Upper Farmington, and the depression in the north
accompanying the ice retreat, reversed the river at Farmington,
and it took a new course on the terrace deposits, escaping by
the sag in the trap at Tariffville into the Connecticut valley.</p>

<p><i>The Quinnipiac.</i> The gorge of the Quinnipiac, already mentioned
several times, seems closely comparable to the gorge of
the Farmington. It is not of the Tertiary cycle, and is best
referred to the inter-glacial or post-glacial epochs. We should
expect the Quinnipiac, instead of turning eastward, to cut
through this sandstone ridge, to continue southward along the
Mill river valley. Dana<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> finds from the heights of the terraces
that the drainage of the terrace-building period was not along
the Quinnipiac, but along the Mill river, and concludes that the
Quinnipiac gorge was obstructed by an ice-dam. I have not as
yet studied it enough in detail to do more than express the
opinion here reiterated, that this gorge is later than the cycle in
which the open sandstone lowland on either side of it was excavated.
Its topographic form would put it in the cycle which
has been called post-Tertiary.</p>

<p><i>The Scantic.</i> In the Scantic we have a typical example of
a river whose lower course is manifestly of a later date than
the upper. In this it is similar to several of our Atlantic rivers,
notably those of North Carolina, whose upper courses are on
the Piedmont crystallines, being probably established previous
to the Cretaceous baseleveling, and whose lower courses stretch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
seaward over the unconsolidated Tertiary deposits of the coastal
plain. As the plain of these recent deposits emerged from the
sea, the rivers were forced to extend their courses eastward over
the freshly raised surface to the retreating shore line. The
Scantic river has a similar history. Its upper course in southern
Massachusetts on the crystalline plateau is a remnant of
the drainage established before Cretaceous baseleveling and
revived by the subsequent uplift. How much that revived drainage
has been modified by drift can only be determined by long
field study, but the topography, as read from the topographical
atlas would seem to indicate, that it has not been much.
The valleys were undoubtedly clogged with drift, and the drainage
area may be somewhat modified, but the drainage seems to
be substantially along the same lines.</p>

<p>Just below the village of Hampden, the Scantic leaves the
plateau and enters the Triassic lowland. From this point to its
mouth at the Connecticut, opposite Windsor, a distance of
twenty miles, it flows nearly all the way through the gravel,
sand and clay deposits of the period of ice-retreat. The topography
of the lower course of the river is entirely characteristic
of a stream which has recently attacked a level, easily eroded
district. The inter-stream surfaces are broad and flat; the
descent to the stream bed which is sunk seventy or eighty feet
below the general surface is exceedingly steep. These two lines,
that of the inter-stream surface and that of the valley side, meet
at a sharp angle. The side streams are as yet very short, and
have cut narrow gorges down to the main river. Tributary to
them are deep side ravines, whose bottoms ascend rapidly to the
inter-stream surface, the whole making a dendritic system of
drainage in its earlier stages. The Scantic, having reached base
level in its lower course, has developed a narrow flood-plain.</p>

<p>Manifestly this part of the river valley is of much later date
than the upper part. If, during the period of ice-retreat, the
lower Connecticut valley was an estuary, the Scantic was a much
shorter river than at present. Its mouth could not have been
far from the point where now it leave the crystallines, but as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
land was elevated and estuarine conditions gave place to fluviatile,
the Scantic lengthened “mouthward,” consequent upon the
minor inequalities of the newly made beds. The effect would be
substantially the same if the terraces were built by great valley
floods, as Dana supposes. In pre-glacial times this river, in
common with several other rivers rising on the crystallines and
flowing into the Connecticut, had courses of various lengths over
the Triassic sandstones, but these old valleys are lost entirely,
the later trenches in the terrace deposits being altogether independent
of them.</p>

<p><i>Other examples.</i> The lower Hockanum, Farmington, Park,
and the entire length of many short streams are similar to the
lower Scantic, and originated under similar conditions. Stony
Brook, a little stream north of Windsor Locks, presents the
same features, but with this variation: It is superimposed
through a thin layer of drift upon the sandstone, into which it
has cut a deep, picturesque gorge. The Hockanum and Farmington
are also “locally superimposed” in a few places. The
Connecticut, also, north of Middletown, although following its
pre-glacial valley, has departed in numerous places from its former
bed, and has cut down through the valley-filling onto ledges
of rock beneath. The water-power at Enfield, Conn., and at
Turner’s Falls and Bellows Falls, Mass., is the result of this
superimposed position.</p>

<p><i>Abandoned gaps.</i> Many abandoned water-gaps must exist
among the hills of the state. Cook’s Gap, through which the New
York and New England Railroad crosses the trap ridge, three
miles west of New Britain, has already been discussed. It must
not be confounded with the majority of the other gaps in the
trap ridge, which are oblique, break the alignment of the ridge,
and are due to faults.</p>

<p>The New York and New England Railroad in ascending to
the eastern plateau passes through Bolton Notch, a few miles east
of Manchester. This notch, also, is an abandoned river bed but,
as it seems, abandoned at a later date and for another reason
than that assigned for Cook’s Gap. The drift is very heavy in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
this region, and the most probable explanation is that the post-glacial
streams do not altogether follow pre-glacial valleys.
This gap, used by turnpike and railroad, testifies of another and
older drainage system.</p>

<p>That in this brief article all the problems connected with
the Connecticut rivers have been solved, or even noted, is not to
be expected. It is hoped, however, that the work done may
prove a help to further study of the same regions, and that the
tentative conclusions advanced may be substantiated by further
investigation.</p>

<h3>GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE LAURENTIAN BASIN.</h3>
</div>

<p>The study of the Pleistocene history of the basin drained by
the St. Lawrence has been fragmentary and is still far from being
complete. There is a lack of agreement in the interpretation
of observations already made, due in part to the comparatively
limited portion of the field examined even by those who have
given the subject most attention, and in part to lack of uniformity
in the standards of comparison used. It is with the hope of
assisting in reaching more harmonious results that attention is
here invited to methods of study.</p>

<p>In the present treatment of the subject it may be advantageously
subdivided, and the facts and hypotheses relating to each
division separately considered. Of the divisions that may be
suggested the following seem the most important:</p>

<p>1. Character of the sub-morainal or hard-rock topography
in the Laurentian basin.</p>

<p>2. Origin of the basin.</p>

<p>3. Sedimentary deposits.</p>

<p>4. Shore markings left by former water-bodies.</p>

<p>5. Fossils in ancient sediments, shore ridges, terraces, etc.</p>

<p>6. Fauna of the present lakes.</p>

<p>7. Changes in elevations of the land.</p>

<p>8. Former outlets.</p>

<p>9. Probable effects of an ice sheet on drainage.</p>

<p>10. Probable effects of a subsidence which would make the
basin an arm of the sea.</p>

<p>1. <i>Character of the hard-rock topography.</i> In order to learn
the character of the Laurentian basin it is necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
examine the rock surface beneath the general covering of
glacial débris and stratified sediments which partially fill
it. To do this, those areas in which rock in place forms the
surface require to be mapped and their elevations noted; the
records of wells and other excavations which pass through the
superficial deposits should also be obtained and the character of
the underlying rock ascertained, as far as is practicable. When
sufficient data of this nature shall have been recorded, a contour
map of the basin can be drawn that will reveal the shape of
the depression with which the student has to deal. The depth
of the present lakes plus an estimated thickness of clay and morainal
material covering their bottoms, will probably furnish the
only means of sketching contours over the deeper portions of
the basin. Even an approximately accurate map of this character
cannot be constructed for a long time to come, but every
advance towards it will serve to make the problems to be studied
more and more definite.</p>

<p>Something of the form of the rock-basin is already known
and several deep channels in its borders, now filled with drift,
have been discovered. The courses of buried channels connecting
the basins of some of the present lakes have also been
approximately determined. It is not necessary at this time to
refer specifically to the discoveries that have been made, but it
may be stated that enough is known to assure us that the basin is
a depression in solid rock, the bottom of which is below sea level.</p>

<p>2. <i>Origin of the basin.</i> The rocks in which the Laurentian
basin is situated are, with the exception of the Lake Superior
region, nearly horizontal and belong almost wholly to the Paleozoic.
The basin is essentially a depression in undisturbed
strata, and all who have considered its origin seem agreed that it
has been formed by excavation. A vast mass of horizontal strata
has been removed, leaving an irregular rim of undisturbed rocks
on all sides. The form of the depression is now obscured by
drift; the deeper portions contain stratified sediments which have
been deposited within it and it has been warped somewhat by
orographic movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
The manner in which the excavation was formed has been
explained principally in two ways. One hypothesis is that it
owes its origin to a time of subaërial denudation preceding the
Glacial epoch, during which a valley, or series of valleys, was
worn out by stream erosion; and that the depression thus produced
has been but slightly modified by ice action. The closing
of the ancient valley has been referred to orographic movements
and to the filling of its outlet by glacial débris. Another
hypothesis is to the effect that the excavation is mainly due to
ice erosion during the Glacial epoch, without special reference to
previous topographic relief. A warping of the earth’s crust so as
to produce a true orographic basin does not seem to require consideration,
for the same reason as already stated, that the rocks
in which the basin lies have been but little disturbed from their
original horizontal position. Future study of the region must determine
which of the two hypotheses outlined above best suits the
facts; or if each hypothesis has something in its favor, what
combination of the two may be accepted as the final explanation.</p>

<p>It is a suggestive fact in connection with the first of these
hypotheses, that the youngest rocks in the region antedating the
Pleistocene belong to the Carboniferous. This seems to show
that the land has not been submerged since at least the close of
the Paleozoic. If not a region of sedimentation during this vast
interval, it must have been subjected to erosion. The erosion of
an ancient land surface might result in the production of topographic
forms of diverse character, depending on its altitude, on
the length of time it was exposed to atmospheric agencies during
various stages of elevation, and on climatic and other conditions.
The study of topographic forms is now sufficiently advanced to
enable one to predict somewhat definitely what features would
appear under certain conditions. We also know the characteristics
of topographic forms due to glacial erosion. It seems
evident, therefore, that a knowledge of the hard-rock topography
in the Laurentian basin, would enable one to draw definite conclusions
in reference to the part that ice and water each had in
shaping the forms now found there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
The conclusion that the region under consideration has been
glaciated is well established; it remains, therefore, to determine
what topographic forms, if any, due to pre-glacial stream erosion
can be recognized. As an example of this kind of evidence
desired, attention may be directed to the northward facing rock
escarpments which follow the southern shores of lakes Erie and
Ontario for a large part of their courses and at varying distances
up to several miles. These escarpments are composed of the edges
of nearly horizontal strata, mostly of Paleozoic limestone, and
their bases are buried beneath glacial débris and stratified clays so
deeply that in some instances, at least, they do not reveal half of
their actual height. These escarpments not only have Pleistocene
deposits banked against them, but their faces and summits are polished
and grooved, showing how stubbornly they resisted the invasion
of the ice which impinged against them from the north. South
of lake Ontario especially, the trend of the escarpment referred
to is directly athwart the course of the ancient glaciers. The
entire history of these escarpments cannot be discussed here, as
my desire is simply to call attention to the fact that they existed
before the Glacial epoch, and are relics of a strongly accented
pre-glacial topography. They are within the southern border
of the Laurentian basin, and hence afford means of determining,
in part, what was the form of that basin before it was modified
by ice action. Other similar escarpments exist in the northern
and western portions of the same great basin, and as this study
progresses it is to be expected that still other features of the
pre-glacial land will be revealed. It is perhaps too early to
decide what were the special topographic forms which gave
character and expression to the St. Lawrence basin before the
ice invasion, but the Erie and Ontario escarpments and some
other similar features now recognized, suggest that in Tertiary
times it resembled the present condition of the upper portion of
the Mississippi valley, where bold, rock escarpments border
wide stream-worn depressions.</p>

<p>Deep drift-filled channels are known to cut across the Erie
and Ontario escarpments. These seem to have been formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
by streams tributary to the main drainage line to the north. If
this conclusion is well founded, a study of the hard-rock
topography should reveal other similar channels and finally indicate
a well matured drainage system. If even the broader and
stronger features of the pre-glacial surface can be determined,
then the modifications due to glacial abrasion will become conspicuous,
and the amount that glaciers have broadened and
deepened the basin be determinable.</p>

<p>A study of the lithological character of the drift south of the
present lakes should show, at least in a rough way, what portion
of it was derived from the waste of rocks within the Laurentian
basin. This inquiry has already been undertaken by at least
two geologists, and estimates of the quantity of material removed
from the basins of lakes Michigan and Erie respectively,
have been made. This method may be extended so as to embrace
a larger area, or some special portion of the great depression best
suited for the trial may be selected. If the material removed from
the basin or re-distributed within it by glacial action can be shown
to be approximately equivalent in volume to the amount of rock
excavated in order to form the depression, it would evidently
tend to support the hypothesis of glacial erosion. If, on the contrary,
the amount of débris derived from the basin should fall
far short of what would be requisite to refill it, no very definite
conclusion would seem to be indicated unless account could also
be taken of the fine material carried away by glacial streams.</p>

<p>As the case stands at present it appears that there is evidence
of a pre-glacial valley or series of valleys as has been claimed
by several geologists, and that all but the boldest features of the
old topography have been obliterated or greatly modified by
glacial erosion followed by glacial and other sedimentation.
Additional observations should show somewhat definitely the
amount of work assignable to particular portions of the history.
How far the results of subaërial and of glacial erosion have been
modified by other agencies, more especially by orographic movements,
has also to be considered.</p>

<p>If the St. Lawrence basin shall be shown to be largely the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
result of subaërial erosion it will follow, unless it is found that
the deeper portions are the result of glacial action, that the land
at the time the streams did their work, must have stood higher
than at present, for the reason that the bottom of the depression
is now below sea level. Some idea of the smallest amount of
elevation necessitated by this hypothesis might be obtained by
estimating the gradients of the ancient streams and the amount
of elevation required to bring the bottom of the depression up
to sea level.</p>

<p>A study of the hard-rock topography in the valleys of the
Ottawa and St. Lawrence and of the present submerged Atlantic
border of the continent would also be instructive in this connection.
The strict correlation of the topographic history of the
interior and of the continent’s margin may be difficult, but as
the two regions are directly connected, valuable results should
follow their comparative study.</p>

<p>The hypothesis that the Laurentian basin is due largely to pre-glacial
erosion, necessitates also that the ancient system of
river valleys should have been closed in some way so as to form
the basins of the present and of former lakes. The closing has
been referred to several agencies. An unequal subsidence following
the period of stream erosion has been postulated.
During the Glacial epoch the entire region was ice-covered and
only glacial streams of one kind or another could have existed.
On the retreat of the ice, when portions of the basin were abandoned,
the drainage is supposed to have been obstructed by the
ice itself, as will be noticed below. When the glaciers melted, a
vast sheet of débris was left which in many instances filled or
obstructed previous drainage lines. Old channels, now deeply
buried, have been reported to connect the basins of the various
existing lakes, as has already been mentioned, but no similar
channel which could have afforded an escape for the waters of
the entire basin has been discovered. Here again an acquaintance
with the hard-rock topography should give assistance and indicate
either that such a channel existed or that orographic movements
have taken place which have obstructed the former drainage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
system. The glacial hypothesis assumes that the basin was
excavated mainly by glacial abrasion and does not require that
the land should be either higher or lower than at present. The
study in this direction merges with that of the general glaciation
of the northeastern part of the continent, and cannot be treated
at this time.</p>

<p>3. <i>Sediments.</i>—Regularly stratified deposits of clay and sand
occur along many portions of the borders of the present Laurentian
lakes. These were clearly formed in water bodies which
formerly existed within the Laurentian basin, and which in certain
directions, at least, were of wider extent than the present
lakes. The areas occupied by these deposits have been partially
mapped, but much remains to be done in this direction. Fresh
sections, particularly of the stratified clays, are exposed from
time to time by artificial excavations, in which much of their
history may be learned. Not only should records be made of
the facts noted at special excavations, but the extent and character
of the stratified deposits in one area should be determined
and compared with similar data obtained in other areas. For
example: the clays covering large tracts on the west shore of
Lake Michigan and on the southern and western border of Lake
Superior are of a red color, while other areas bordering Lake
Erie are covered with blue clay. These two deposits have been
supposed to have been laid down at the same time and in the
same lake. The definite correlation of the clays of these two
areas by direct contact, however, does not seem to have been
made, and there are reasons for thinking that they may be quite
distinct and that they originated in separate lakes.</p>

<p>The outer limits of the deposits of clay and sand here referred
to are known in some instances to be determined by
ancient beaches and terraces. Such associations of deep and
of shallow water deposits require special attention, as the
study of one may assist in interpreting the significance of
the other. The fine, evenly stratified clays frequently contain
large angular bowlders, which appear to have been dropped from
floating ice and to show an intimate connection between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
ancient lakes and neighboring glaciers. The possibility, however,
of the bowlders having been brought into the ancient water
bodies by rivers, or floated outwards from the shore by lake ice,
should also be considered. Huge angular masses of limestone
have been reported as occurring in southern Michigan especially,
which rest on superficial deposits and are thought to have been
carried northward by lake ice. The relations of these masses to
well defined shore lines have never been determined. If it
should be found that they are above all former shores, it is evident
that they must have been carried by some other agency
than the one mentioned.</p>

<p>A chemical examination of the clays, or of their contained
water, may indicate whether or not the basin was formerly in
direct communication with the ocean. Analyses of the clays of
the Champlain valley and of the similar clays in the Ontario
and Erie basins might indicate whether or not they were
deposited under similar conditions.</p>

<p>4. <i>Shore records.</i> Beaches and terraces have been studied at
many localities about the borders of the present lakes, sometimes
at a distance of more than twenty miles from their margins and
at various elevations up to several hundred feet above their surfaces.
In some instances these ancient shore records have been
followed continuously for scores of miles. The tracing and mapping
of individual beaches is one of the most important parts of
the study here outlined, and is already well advanced. Confusion
has unfortunately arisen, however, for the reason that topographic
features, due to shore action, have, in some instances, been confounded
with somewhat similar features due to other causes.
Moraines and gravel ridges, formed by glacial streams, have been
mistaken for beach ridges, and terraces of various origin have
not been clearly discriminated.</p>

<p>In order not to be led astray by topographic forms that simulate
shore phenomena, the student should examine the shores of
existing lakes and learn what records are there being made.
In the study of topography, “the present is the key to the
past,” just as definitely as in any other branch of geology. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
topography of lake shores has already received attention from
one skilled in reading geological history in the relief of the
land<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and the study of existing shores in the light of what has
already been done in that direction should enable even the beginner
to avoid falling into serious error in interpreting ancient records
of the same nature.</p>

<p>To be able to discriminate clearly between shore features and
somewhat similar glacial phenomena, it is necessary to become
familiar also with the topography of glacial deposits. Fortunately
in this study also a guide is at hand<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> which, in connection
with field observations, should soon train the eye to discriminate
the shapes assumed by moraines and the deposits of glacial
streams from all other topographic forms.</p>

<p>In examining the records of former lakes it will soon be
observed that, in many instances, where the highest of a series of
ancient beaches is obscure and indefinite, the topographic expression
above and below a certain horizon, and also the character of
the surface material, whether of the nature of lacustral clays and
sands or of glacial débris, residual clay, etc., above and below
the same level, are significant, and enable one to map the outline
of a former water body with considerable accuracy.</p>

<p>In tracing ancient beaches and terraces, their forms and internal
structure need to be recorded, so that the fact of their being
true shore records may be made plain to others. The elevations
of various well-defined points throughout the extent of an
ancient shore should be carefully measured, for, as will be noticed
below, although originally horizontal, they have, in many
instances, been elevated or depressed, owing to broad general
movements of the earth’s crust. The continuous tracing of individual
shore lines for as great a distance as possible is highly
desirable, especially in a wooded country, in order to be positive
as to which ridge or terrace measurements of elevation relate, and
also for the purpose of observing the nature of the changes that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
occur when a shore line gives place to other records. For example:
some of the ancient beach ridges about the west end of Lake
Erie have been found to be continuations of moraines. In other
instances shore ridges have been reported to end indefinitely and
to be replaced at the same general horizon by glacial records of
various character. The correct interpretation of phenomena of
this nature is especially important.</p>

<p>Accurate measurements of the vertical intervals between well
defined beaches at many localities would enable one to identify
special horizons, providing orographic movements were not in
progress during the time the series was forming. This method
has recently been successfully applied on the north shore of
Lake Superior, where the character of the country does not
admit of the tracing of individual terraces for considerable
distances.</p>

<p>The deltas of tributary streams should also be revealed in the
topography of the basin of an ancient water body. Changes in
the character of lacustral sediments near where rivers emptied
are also to be looked for. Sand dunes are frequently an important
accompaniment of existing shores, and their association,
perhaps, in a modified form, with ancient beaches is to be
expected.</p>

<p>5. <i>Fossils.</i> Thus far only a few fossils have been found in
the stratified clays and sands or in the ancient beaches of the
Laurentian basin. Such observations as have been made in this
connection indicate an absence of the remains of marine life and
the presence, in a few instances, of fresh-water shells in all of the
basin west of the eastern border of the basin of Lake Ontario.
To the eastward of Lake Ontario, however, in the St. Lawrence
and Champlain valleys, marine fossils are common in deposits
supposed to be contemporaneous with the stratified clays to the
west.</p>

<p>A careful search in the clays and beaches left by the former
water bodies might be rewarded by important discoveries. In
this examination microscopical organisms should not be neglected.
If after a detailed examination no fossils are discovered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
this negative evidence would have its value, as it would
indicate that the physical conditions were not favorable to life,
and an explanation for this fact might be found. It is scarcely
necessary to mention that care should be taken not to mistake
the shells occurring in modern swamp deposits associated with
the ancient beaches for true lacustral fossils.</p>

<p>About the borders of the present lakes and sometimes even
below the level of the lowest of the ancient beaches the remains
of the mastodon, elephant, giant beaver, elk, bison, deer, etc.,
have been found. The recency of the existence of such of these
animals as are extinct may thus be established, as well as the
former distribution of those still living in other regions.</p>

<p>Evidence of the existence of man has been reported from
one of the old lake ridges in New York, and it is important that
this interesting discovery should be sustained by evidence from
other localities. Stone implements especially should be looked
for in undisturbed lacustral clays, and in the gravels of the
ancient beaches.</p>

<p>The remains of forests have been stated to occur in the lacustral
clays adjacent to the south shore of Lake Erie. It is desirable
to know the extent of these deposits and how continuous
they are; also the character of the plant remains they contain,
and whether they have been disturbed from the position in which
they grew. Some of the questions that may be asked in this
connection are: Was the basin drained and forest covered before
the vegetable remains were buried, or were the plants floated to
their present position, or did they grow on moraines covering the
stagnant border of the retreating glacier and become involved
and buried in morainal material as the ice melted?</p>

<p>6. <i>Life in the present lakes.</i> The fauna of the present lakes
has a bearing on their past history, for the reason that in the
deeper parts of lakes Superior and Michigan crustaceans and
fishes have been found which are believed to be identical with
marine forms. These may be considered as “living fossils,”
and are thought by some to indicate that the lakes in which they
occur were formerly in direct communication with the ocean. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
the occurrence of living marine species in the present lakes is
found to be widely at variance with the history of the basin as
determined from physical evidence, an inquiry should be made
in reference to the manner in which the species discovered might
migrate.</p>

<p>7. <i>Changes in elevation.</i> One of the most difficult problems
in connection with the history of an inland region is the determination
of changes of level. By leveling along an ancient
beach, post-lacustral changes in the relative elevations of various
points may be readily ascertained. Pre-lacustral changes, however,
by which ancient valleys have been obstructed, are much
more difficult of direct observation, but might appear from the
study of the hard-rock topography, as has already been suggested.
This branch of the investigation, however, should more
properly begin at the coast and be extended inland.</p>

<p>8. <i>Former outlets.</i> Several localities where the waters of the
Laurentian basin have overflowed during former high-water
stages have been pointed out, but some confusion has arisen in
this connection, for the reason that the channels formed by streams
issuing from the margin of the ice during the closing stages of
the Glacial epoch have, in some instances, been mistaken for evidence
of former lake outlets. The old outlets which seem to
have been well determined are situated at different levels, and
show that the entire basin could not have been occupied by a
single great water-body, unless, as has been supposed by some,
it was in direct communication with the sea. This hypothesis
will be considered below. It has sometimes been assumed that
all of the basin below the level of some ancient outlet was once
flooded, so as to form a great lake in all of the basin now situated
at a lower level; but, in making such generalizations, the possibility
of places in the rim of the basin being at a lower level than
the outlet discovered, thus necessitating a special explanation,
such as the partial occupation of the basin by glacial ice, or
changes in elevation of such a character as to raise the locality
of former overflow or to depress other regions, have to be considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
Former outlets should bear a definite relation to neighboring
shore lines and to sedimentary deposits. The channels leading
from former points of discharge merit examination, as here again
changes of level may perhaps be detected in the gradients of
stream terraces.</p>

<p>Most of the ancient outlets thus far recognized lead southward,
but as previously mentioned, a former channel of discharge
north of Lake Superior has recently been reported. If this
observation is confirmed, it will have an important bearing on
questions relating to changes of level and to the position of the
ice front during the later stages in the retreat of the glaciers.</p>

<p>9. <i>Probable effects of a retreating ice sheet on drainage.</i> The
generally accepted conclusion that glaciers advanced southward
and occupied the Laurentian basin during the Glacial epoch and
retreated northward toward the close of that epoch, is sustained
by a vast body of evidence. As the ice sheet withdrew it left a
superficial deposit frequently one or two hundred feet thick over
nearly all of the region it abandoned, and pre-glacial drainage
lines were obstructed and mostly obliterated. As long as the
slope in front of the ice was southward, the drainage from it
found ready means of escape, but when the slope was northward
towards the ice front, the drainage was obstructed and lakes were
formed.</p>

<p>We have good reasons for believing that the topography of
the Laurentian region was essentially the same at the close of
the Glacial epoch as it is now, but the broader question of continental
elevation is less definite. The inequalities of the surface
being essentially as we now find them, it would follow that the
first lake formed when the ice retreated to the north of the
divide running through central Ohio and central New York,
would be small and dependent on minor features in the relief of
the land, and would discharge southward. As the ice retreated,
the lakes would expand and become united one with another and
the larger lakes thus formed would still find outlet across the
southern rim of the basin. As the glaciers continued to retreat
lower and lower, passes would become free of ice and the lakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
would be drained at lower levels, old beaches would be abandoned,
the lakes would contract, and finally separate lakes
would be formed in the lowest depression in the basins of the
more ancient water bodies. The shape of the retreating ice
front would be determined by topographic conditions and would
in turn determine the northern outline of the lakes along its
margin. This in brief is one hypothesis that has been proposed
to explain the varied history recorded by the shore records,
sediments, etc., within the basin.</p>

<p>10. <i>Communication with the sea.</i> Another hypothesis which
assumes to account for some of the facts observed, is that the continent
was depressed at the close of the Glacial epoch sufficiently
to allow the sea to have access to the Laurentian basin. This
hypothesis is coupled with others which do not recognize a
period of Pleistocene glaciation, but, as already suggested, this is
a matter that is considered by the great body of American
geologists as not being any longer open to profitable discussion.</p>

<p>In the study here outlined the question whether the water
bodies which formerly occupied the Laurentian basin were lakes
or arms of the sea, should not be difficult of direct and positive
determination. If fossils can be found within the basin, they
might yield definite testimony, but even if they are absent or
if their evidence is inconclusive, topography can be appealed to
with the expectation of receiving a conclusive decision.</p>

<p>If the Laurentian basin was occupied by an arm of the sea
during various stages in the Pleistocene elevation, then the
records of such a submergence should occur both within and
without the depression, and direct connection between the
two should be expected. If the waters within the basin were
capable of making such well-defined shore records as are now
found, we are justified in assuming that the true ocean beach on
the outer slopes of the basin would be still more conspicuous.
Again, the waters within the basin deposited a sheet of sediment,
certainly not less than one hundred feet thick; to be sure the
conditions for rapid accumulation were there present, but if the
ocean covered the adjacent land it should have left similar deposits.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
This is abundantly proven in the St. Lawrence and
Champlain valleys, where clays containing marine fossils occur
up to a certain horizon and record a Pleistocene invasion of these
depressions by the sea. If the adjacent Ontario basin was
occupied by the sea about the same time that the Champlain
valley received its filling of clays containing marine fossils, there
is every reason to believe that the deposits and their contained
fossils in each basin would have been essentially the same.</p>

<p>One of the best known of the ancient shore lines about Lake
Ontario has an average elevation of approximately 500 feet
above the sea. If the sea had access to the basin at the time
this breech was formed, then at corresponding horizon without
the basin especially, to the south and southeast, where the full
force of the Atlantic’s waves would have been felt, there should
be still more prominent beaches.</p>

<p>Many well-defined shore lines in the Laurentian basin are
much higher than the one just referred to, and if these were also
formed during various stages of submergence, as has been
claimed, it is evident that ocean beaches and ocean sediments
of Pleistocene age should be looked for over nearly the whole
of the eastern part of the United States. The student may
easily answer this question for himself, and thus perhaps make
a contribution to the subject here treated.</p>

<p>In the investigation here outlined, the work of previous observers
should not be ignored, and every plausible hypothesis
that has been advanced to account for the facts observed should
be carefully tested. In writing these pages I have not quoted
the writing of others, for the reason that a discussion of evidence
has not been the aim in view, and also because the writings
examined are so numerous that justice could not be done them
in the space at command. That the literature relating to the
subject is voluminous is indicated by the fact that an annotated
bibliography of the Pleistocene history of the Laurentian basin,
now in preparation, already contains over 200 entries of individual
papers.</p>

<p>The Summer meeting of the Geological Society of America
will be held at Madison, Wis., on August 15 and 16. The session
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
will begin at the same place on the 17th of August and extend
to the 23d. The Congress of Geologists, under the auspices of
the Columbian Exposition, will begin at Chicago, on August 24,
and continue its sessions so long as its work may require. Preliminary
to this series of meetings, Professors M. E. Wadsworth
and C. R. Van Hise will meet such geologists as care to visit the
Lake Superior region at the Commercial Hotel, Iron Mountain,
Mich., on the forenoon of August 7, and will act as guides during
the week following. A carefully prepared scheme for the
trip is announced, embracing visits to the leading points of interest
in the Menominee, Marquette and Gogebic iron districts, and
in the copper-bearing region of Keweenaw Point. Those who
desire to participate in the excursion, or who wish information
regarding it, should address Professor Van Hise, at Madison.</p>

<p>In connection with the meetings of the Geological Society and
the American Association at Madison, there will be excursions
to the Devil’s Lake region, to the Dells of the Wisconsin, and
to the driftless area, under the guidance of geologists personally
familiar with the features of most special interest. The article
of Professor Van Hise in this number is a timely presentation
of some points of peculiar significance in the first named region,
and will prove very serviceable to those who choose the excursion
to that region.</p>

<p>It is proposed to hold the sessions of the Congress at Chicago
at the Art Institute during the forenoons, leaving the afternoons
free for visiting the Exposition. Experience has shown
that a half day devoted to looking at exhibits, where there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
such a plethora of objects of interest as in the Exposition, taxes
the faculties of observation to the full extent of their pleasurable
employment. Attendance upon the Congress and the study
of the Exposition will, therefore, it is thought, constitute agreeable
and profitable complements of each other. Excursions to
points of geological interest in the vicinity of Chicago will be
privately arranged, if desired.</p>

<p>These three meetings, with the attending excursions and the
study of the Exposition, constitute a rare combination of opportunities
which will doubtless be embraced very generally by the
geologists of the country.</p>

<p>Travelers and foreign residents in South America are rapidly
furnishing information relative, not only to the volcanic, but also to the
older crystalline rocks composing the great Andes chain. Since the
early observations of Darwin,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> the petrographical collections made by
Stelzner during his three years’ residence, as professor, at Cordova
(1873–1876) have been described by himself<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> and Franke,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> while the
results of detailed studies of the more extensive collections gathered
by Stelzner’s successor, Professor L. Brackebusch, are now beginning
to appear. Professor Brackebusch’s residence in the Argentine Republic
lasted from 1876 till 1883, and during this period he made numerous
scientific expeditions.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The petrographical material thus obtained
has been confided to specialists in Germany for study. Three papers
dealing with the crystalline schists (gneisses),<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> pegmatites,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> and granites,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
have recently appeared. The rocks of the granite contact-zones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
had been placed in Professor Lessen’s hands before his death, while
communications on other special groups are doubtless to be expected.</p>

<p>These investigations naturally suffer from the forced absence of all
field observations on the part of their authors, but the purely petrographical
study of the material brings to light many points of interest,
while it furnishes the only sort of detailed information regarding the
rocks of these remote regions which we can for the present hope for.
It is here desired only to direct attention to a few of the most striking
results obtained from the Brackebusch material by the three authors
last cited.</p>

<p>Dr. Kühn’s paper on the crystalline schists treats principally of
gneiss, and offers little that is new. It is mostly occupied with additional
evidence of structural and chemical changes due to dynamic metamorphism
in the sense of Lehmann. The most noteworthy of these
are development and microstructure of fibrolite; production of augen-gneiss
from porphyritic granite; development of microcline structure
in orthoclase by pressure; secondary origin of microcline, microperthite
and micropegmatite; alteration of garnet to biotite and hornblende.</p>

<p>Dr. Sabersky’s paper on the coarse-grained granites or pegmatites
is entirely mineralogical, and is devoted principally to elucidating the
structure of microcline. The author concludes that the well-known
gridiron structure is due, not to two twinning laws (the Albite and
Pericline), as has been generally supposed, but to the Albite law alone,
in accordance with which the individuals form both contact and penetration
twins, like the albite crystals from Roc-tourné, described by G.
Rose.</p>

<p>Dr. Romberg’s paper on the Argentine granites is much more
extensive than the two preceding. It is embellished by seventy-two
microphotographs, many of which admirably illustrate the special
points described. He comes to several results of great petrographical
significance, the most important of which relate to the origin of quartz-feldspar
intergrowths in granitic rocks. He clearly shows that beside
the original granite quartz there is also much of a secondary nature
present. This is not microscopically distinguishable from the original
mineral, but its later genesis is demonstrated by many careful observations
on its relation to other constituents. The abundant secondary
quartz is regarded as the product of weathering—principally of the
feldspar, into which it has a peculiar tendency to penetrate. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
extreme sensitiveness of quartz to pressure is emphasized (as it has been
by Lehmann and the present writer) and illustrated by undulatory
extinction, banding, granulation and even plastic bending around other
minerals. Dynamic action is regarded as the efficient cause of the
secondary impregnation of feldspar by quartz, and a union of this with
weathering of the feldspar as the source of the abundant and complex
pegmatitic intergrowths of quartz and feldspar.</p>

<p>These results are important, and they will now doubtless come to
be generally recognized. It is, however, of interest to observe in this
connection that all which is here announced as new in regard to secondary
and “corrosion” quartz was described and figured in even
greater detail by Prof. R. D. Irving ten years ago. This does not
appear to be known to Dr. Romberg, for he does not allude to it, but
anyone who will turn to pages 99 to 124 and plates XIII, XIV and XV
of the monograph on the Lake Superior Copper Rocks (vol. 5, U. S.
Geol. Survey, Washington, 1883) will find his conclusions stated in
almost the same language and with a much wider range of fact and illustration.
Dynamic action is not here adduced as a cause for the saturation
of feldspar by secondary micropegmatitic quartz, since the Lake
Superior rocks show no evidence of having been subjected to pressure,
but that the quartz itself has been derived from the leaching of the
feldspar substance and that the impregnation is mostly confined to the
orthoclase is clearly stated.</p>

<p>Dr. Romberg also demonstrates, in a number of cases, the secondary
origin of albite, especially as microperthite, and of microcline. He
gives details relating to each of the mineral constituents, and then the
effects of pressure and of chemical action on the most important of
them. Among many interesting observations but a few can be even
mentioned here; such, for instance, as the original character of muscovite
in many granites; the alteration of garnet into muscovite; the
dependence of the well-known pleochroic halos in biotite and cordierite
upon the substance of the zircon which they almost invariably surround,
and secondary rutile needles which grow out from biotite into
both quartz and feldspar. In one rock occurring in a granite a violet,
strongly pleochroic mineral was found, which, in neither composition
nor physical properties, agreed exactly with any known species. It
seems to be intermediate between andalusite and dumortierite, but, as
its individuality is not yet perfectly established, no new name is proposed
for it.</p>

<h4 class="hang"><i>The Mineral Industry, its Statistics, Technology and Trade, in the United
States and Other Countries, from the Earliest Times to the End of
1892.</i> Vol. I. Edited by <span class="smcap">Richard P. Rothwell</span>, editor of the
<i>Engineering and Mining Journal</i>. 629 pp., 8vo.</h4>

<p>This volume is a statistical supplement of the <cite>Engineering and Mining
Journal</cite>, and is published by the Scientific Publishing Co., of New
York, 1893. It takes the place of the former annual statistical number
of the <cite>Engineering and Mining Journal</cite>, and it is the first volume
of a series which is to be issued annually. The object of the present
volume is to make known, as soon as possible after the expiration of
the year 1892, the statistics and the various conditions of the mining
industry in that year and in previous years. The future volumes will,
each year, bring these statistics up to date, and thus the full particulars
of the mining industry will be known within a few days of the expiration
of every year. The volume is a compilation of articles written by
different authors, and the names of these writers are guarantee that the
different subjects have been treated by authorities in the departments
with which they deal. The editor himself, it is but justice to him to
state, has written some of the most important parts of the volume, notably
the article on the statistics of gold and silver, and his well-known
familiarity with the subjects he discusses renders the reader confident
of their accuracy.</p>

<p>The present volume is not confined to the bare presentation of figures
of production and consumption of various mineral products, but
it treats each individual branch of the mining industry in its various
departments; and in this way the volume really represents a series of
treatises on the various mining products and the methods of treating
them. The production of each material is given not only for the United
States but also for foreign countries; the conditions of the American
and foreign markets during 1892 and previous years are discussed,
while the various uses of the different materials, the history of mining
in different districts, the means of transportation, the metallurgical
methods of treating different ores, the methods of sampling, and the
possibilities of competition in various mining industries are also
described. In addition to this, tables of assessments levied and dividends
paid by various mining companies are given. The volume ends
with a concise statement of the statistics and condition, as well as the
extent, of the mining industries of foreign countries. Thus there is
presented, in a volume of no excessive size, a complete and concise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
epitome of the mining industries of the world; and this work was
completed almost immediately after the time to which it relates.</p>

<p>The various subjects are treated in the following order: A résumé
and tables of statistics of the mineral products of the United States;
articles on Aluminum, Antimony, Asbestos, Asphaltum, Barytes, Bauxite,
Borax, Bromine, Cement, Chemical Industry, Chromium, Coal and
Coke, Copper, Corundum and Emery, Cryolite, Feldspar, Fluorspar, Gold
and Silver, Iron and Steel, Lead, Manganese, Mica, Nickel and Cobalt,
Onyx, Petroleum, Phosphate Rock, Platinum Group of Metals, Plumbago,
Precious Stones, Pyrites, Quicksilver, Salt, Soda, Sulphur, Talc,
Tin, Whetstones and Novaculite, Zinc; Tables of Assessments Levied
by Mining Companies from 1887–1893; Tables of Dividends Paid by
American Mining Companies; Baltimore Mining Stock Market, Boston
Mining Stock Market, Denver Mining Stock Market, London Mining
Stock Market, Lake Superior Mining Stock Market, New York
Mining Stock Market, Paris Mining Stock Market, Pittsburg Mining
Stock Market, Salt Lake City Mining Stock Market in 1892, San Francisco
Mining Stock Market; Foreign Countries—Austria-Hungary,
Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, South
American Countries, Spain and Cuba, Sweden, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>The importance of the subject treated in this volume can be appreciated
when it is known that the products of the mines of the United
States alone in the census year of 1889 amounted to $587,230,662, and
that this amount really only represents the interest on an immensely
larger capital invested. The mining products of the United States are
far more important in their aggregate value than those of any other
country in the world, though, in many individual products, other countries
supply more than the United States. This country is first, however,
in the production of pig iron and steel. It is also first in the
production of copper, gold, silver, petroleum, and a number of other
products. Great Britain is still the leader in the production of coal,
but the United States’ production is rapidly growing and already equals
81.08% of the British production, and supplies 28.75% of the world’s
consumption.</p>

<p>Every subject in this volume is fully discussed, and at the same time
nothing is given which is not appropriate and even necessary. Thus a
combination of completeness and conciseness is reached which is excellent.
Among the most carefully and exhaustively treated subjects are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
copper, gold and silver, the platinum group of metals and coal and
iron, though many others might be mentioned, for every subject undertaken
has been thoroughly treated. In the article on copper the statistics
of production and consumption, as well as the condition of the
various domestic and foreign markets, are fully discussed by the editor,
and, in addition, separate articles are also given on “American Methods
of Ore Sampling and Assaying,” by Albert R. Ledoux, and on
“Bessemerizing Copper Matte,” by Charles Wade Stickney. The
article on the statistics of gold and silver is by Mr. R. P. Rothwell,
editor of the volume, and is an excellent piece of statistical work, giving,
as it does, the statistics of production of gold and silver in the
world for a number of years back. To this article are appended interesting
papers on the “Chronology of the Gold and Silver Industry,
1492–1892,” by Walker Renton Ingalls, on “Recent Improvements in
Gold Chlorination,” by John E. Rothwell, and on the “Cyanide
Process,” by Louis Janin, Jr.</p>

<p>The article on the Platinum Group of Metals, by Charles Bullman,
gives complete information regarding the production, consumption,
nature of the deposits, metallurgy and uses of platinum and its
related metals, iridium, rhodium, osmium, palladium and ruthenium.
The articles on Coal and Coke and on Iron and Steel, both by
Mr. Wm. B. Phillips, give full statistics of production and consumption,
as well as interesting historical data, and reports of the condition of various
markets. Many of the other articles in this volume deserve
mention, but lack of space forbids further detail. It may be said,
however, that everything necessary is presented, and nothing unnecessary
or unreliable is given; in other words, the volume contains no
trash.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable features of the volume is the uniform
and systematic manner in which the results are presented. The uniform
arrangement of statistics is a matter requiring the greatest labor
and statistical ability. Compiling a single table of statistics is a simple
matter, but arranging a vast mass of statistics, relating to many diverse
subjects, on a uniform and intelligible basis, is entirely another matter,
and requires the highest skill of the statistician. In the Mineral
Industry this has been accomplished in a most successful manner;
everything is clear and intelligible at the first glance, and everything
is in its proper place. A great detriment to the systematic presentation
of statistics has been, as pointed out by the editor, the necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
of using our present system of weights and measures, with “our long
and short tons, our barrels of 200, 280, 300 or 400 lbs, our
pounds avoirdupois and our pounds Troy, our bushels of a dozen different
weights, and our gallons of several incomprehensible kinds”;
but the disadvantages of this system have been partly avoided in
many cases by giving the statistics in metric measures as well as in our
own.</p>

<p>The question of the cost of production has been given especial
prominence in this volume, with a view to showing the reduction in
the cost of the crude products. To use the words of the editor:
“The itemization of cost is the first essential step in securing economy
in producing any article, and the history of every country and of
every industry has shown that prosperity, whether national, industrial,
or individual, is, in a general way, inversely proportional to the cost
of supplying the rest of the world with what one produces.” These
reductions are in no way dependent on the reduction of wages. On the
contrary, many of the mining industries where the greatest reduction
in cost of production has been accomplished, are carried on with high
priced labor; and in many other cases, where the wages are not high, the
condition of the wage-earners has been greatly improved. The
reduction in cost of production has been entirely brought about by
improvements in mining machinery, by a more thorough understanding
of the nature of the deposits to be worked, and by more
intelligent management and labor. The reduction in cost of production
is nowhere better seen than in the materials most necessary to
our welfare. For instance, coal can in some cases be carried by rail
for 400 miles and delivered on board vessels for from $2 to $2.25 per
ton, and yet the mine owners and railroads make dividends; some of
the manufacturing establishments in Western Pennsylvania obtain coal
at from 60 to 75 cents per ton at their works; hard gold-bearing
quartz can be crushed, washed and 95 per cent. of the gold saved on
the plates for $1.25 per ton; high grade Bessemer iron ore can be
mined, handled, shipped and delivered a thousand miles from the
point of production for less than $4.00 per ton. All these figures seem
almost incredible until one investigates the various devices which the
ingenuity and better education of those engaged in the industry have
invented for reducing the expenses of production.</p>

<p>The former annual statistical numbers of the Engineering and
Mining Journal were excellent in all they undertook, but the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
volume, the Mineral Industry, makes a great advance in giving the
statistics for foreign countries in addition to those of the United
States. By so doing it gives the American producers an opportunity
to know the present, past and probable future conditions of
competition in foreign countries.</p>

<p>The two most important features in any statistical work are
accuracy and promptness. The necessity of accuracy is self-evident,
and without promptness the statistics lose much of their serviceability
to those most interested in them, for the statistics of an industry published
a year or two years late are rarely of much value to those
engaged in that industry. The business man wants his statistics
immediately after the expiration of the time to which they relate,
so that he may know the existing condition of the industry in which he
is engaged; but if he does not get these statistics until many months or
even several years afterwards, the condition of the industry may have
changed entirely since the time to which the statistics refer. It is the
promptness with which this volume is issued, combined with a high
degree of accuracy, far greater than would be expected in statistics so
hastily compiled, that gives it its especial value.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be said, that as a piece of statistical work,
relating to an industry that is world-wide in its scope, combining
accuracy with full detail and systematic arrangement, and issued so
soon after the close of the time to which it relates, the Mineral Industry
has never been equaled in this country or abroad. The former
statistical numbers of the Engineering and Mining Journal, which
referred mostly only to American mining, were considered remarkable
pieces of statistical work, on account of the promptness of their publication;
but in the Mineral Industry we have an epitome of the mining
operations of every quarter of the globe, published almost immediately
after the close of the time to which they refer, a feat which heretofore
would have been declared impossible. This accomplishment is
most creditable to the editor, Mr. Rothwell, to the systematic organization
of the Scientific Publishing Co., and to the business manager,
Mrs. Braeunlich, by whose business ability such an expensive undertaking
is made commercially practicable. The volume will be found
of the greatest value to the economic geologist, the miner, the
engineer and the business man.</p>

<h3><i>A New Tæniopteroid Fern and its Allies.</i> By <span class="smcap">David White</span>. (Bulletin
Geological Society of America, 4 pp., 119–122, pl. I.).</h3></blockquote>

<p>Mr. White has described, under the name of <em>Tæniopteris missouriensis</em>,
a new and well characterized fern from the Lower Coal-measures in the
vicinity of Clinton, Henry County, Missouri. Botanically, it is of particular
interest in that it combines the so-called tæniopteroid and alethopteroid types
of structure, while geologically it is of much value in supplying a readily
identified stratigraphic mark in a part of the Carboniferous not especially
rich in fossil plants. After thoroughly describing it and considering its specific
and generic resemblances, the author discusses at length its suggested
genetic relations and represents in a graphic manner a scheme of its probable
ancestors and line of descent.</p>

Magazine. Vol. V., April 29, 1893, pp. 45–58 pl. 20).</h3></blockquote>

<p>The paper confines itself to the characteristic distribution of precipitation
throughout the year and gives the rainfall types of the country.</p>

<p>(a) The best defined type of rainfall within the United States is that
which dominates the Pacific coast region as far east as western Utah. The
characteristic features are a very heavy precipitation during midwinter, and
an almost total absence of rain during the late summer. (b) The characteristics
of the Mexican type, dominating Mexico, New Mexico and western
Texas, are a very heavy precipitation after the summer solstice and a very
dry period after the vernal equinox. August is the month of greatest rainfall,
while February, March and April are almost free from precipitation.
(c) The Missouri type covers the greatest area, dominating the watersheds
of the Arkansas, Missouri and upper Mississippi rivers, and of lakes
Ontario and Michigan. It is marked by a very light winter precipitation,
followed in late spring and early summer by the major portion of the
yearly rain, the period when it is most beneficial to the growing grain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
(d) The Tennessee type, prevailing in Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi
and Alabama, has the highest rainfall the last of winter, while the minimum
is in mid-autumn. (e) The Atlantic type, covering all the coast save
New England, is one where the distribution throughout the year is nearly uniform,
with a maximum precipitation after the summer solstice, and a minimum
during mid-autumn. (f) The St. Lawrence type is characterized by
scarcity during the spring months, heavy rainfall during the late summer and
late autumn months, with a maximum during November.</p>

<p>The regions lying between these several type-regions have composite rainfall
types, resulting from the influence of two or more simple types.</p>

<h3><i>The Geographic Development of the Eastern Part of the Mississippi
Drainage System.</i> By <span class="smcap">Lewis G. Westgate</span>, Middletown, Conn.
(American Geologist, Vol. XI, April, 1893, 15 pp.)</h3></blockquote>

<p>The drainage of the Eastern Mississippi basin in post-carboniferous was
in all probability consequent upon the tilting which accompanied the stronger
folds of the Appalachian revolution in the east. The present drainage is
found to accord in the main with this hypothetical post-carboniferous drainage,
but several streams depart quite widely from it.</p>

<p>(a) The great drainage lines of the St. Lawrence basin are structural
valleys developed along the strike of the softer Paleozoic strata, and at right
angles to the original surface. The streams seem, therefore, to have adjusted
themselves to the differences in hardness and structure of the beds discovered.
(b) The Ohio and Cumberland rivers cut directly across the Tennessee
and Cincinnati anticlines. The most probable explanation is that the
rivers were superimposed upon the arched and eroded Silurian rocks from a
thin cover of carboniferous beds—now entirely removed. (c) The Upper
Mississippi does not follow the dip of the rocks to the southwest, but follows
the strike to the southeast. This part of the river probably dates from the
elevation of the plains on the west and the Appalachians on the east, which
marked the close of the Cretaceous and which left a broad north and south
valley. (d) The author finds good reason to believe that the Lower Mississippi,
in post-carboniferous times, flowed west through Missouri and Arkansas.
The present course was probably taken at the close of the Cretaceous in consequence
of elevations on the west and east, and possible depression in the
south.</p>

<p>The Cretaceous base-level recognized by Davis on the Atlantic slope can
be traced more or less discontinuously, and remnants of it are believed to
exist in Kentucky, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Arkansas. But in
general the work of the Tertiary cycle has obliterated almost all evidence of
it on all but the hard sandstones and conglomerates of the Paleozoic series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
Good examples of the lowlands excavated from the Cretaceous base-level
during the Tertiary cycle, are the Valley of the East Tennessee and the central
lowland of Kentucky and Tennessee. During the post-Tertiary sub-cycle
the larger streams trenched to greater or less extent these lowlands. No
attempt is made to carry the history of the development of the Mississippi,
drainage into the complicated chapter of the ice-invasion.</p>

<h3><i>On a New Order of Gigantic Fossils.</i> By <span class="smcap">Erwin H. Barbour</span>. (University
Studies. Published by the University of Nebraska. Vol.
I, No. 4, July, 1892, pp. 23, pl. 5).</h3></blockquote>

<p>A part of Sioux County, Nebraska, lying north of the Niobrara River,
has yielded a new order of gigantic Miocene fossils unlike anything heretofore
known. They are best described as fossil corkscrews, of great size,
coiling in right-handed or left-handed curves about an actual axis or around
an imaginary axis. The screws are often attached at the bottom to an
immense transverse piece, rhizome, underground stem, or whatever it may be,
which is sometimes three feet in diameter. In other cases the corkscrew
ends abruptly downward, as it always does upwards. In still other cases the
transverse piece is variously modified, and sometimes blends into the sandstone
matrix, as if the underground stem, while growing at one end, was
decaying at the other. The fossil corkscrew is invariably vertical, and the
so-called rhizome invariably curves rapidly upwards, and extends outwards
an indefinite distance.</p>

<p>That they could ever have been formed by burrowing animals, by geysers
or springs, or by any mechanical means whatever, is entirely untenable.
Their organic origin is unquestionable. Microscopic sections show smooth
spindle-shaped rods, which are suggestive of sponge spicules. From the
numbers seen in place it is evident that they flourished in thickly crowded
forests of vast extent.</p>

<p>A finely preserved rodent’s skeleton was found in one great stem. The
probable explanation is not that the rodent burrowed there, but that its submerged
skeleton became an anchorage for a living, growing Daimonelix,
which eventually enveloped it.</p>

<h3><i>The Vertical Relief of the Globe.</i> By <span class="smcap">Hugh Robert Mill</span>, D.Sc.,
F.R.S.E. Scottish Geographical Magazine, April, 1890.</h3></blockquote>

<p>The purpose of Dr. Mill’s paper is to show a simple yet adequate basis
on which to build the superstructure of physical geography. It does not
attempt a discussion of the distribution and varieties of vertical relief. The
structure of the earth is stated most simply by describing it as an irregular
stony ball, covered with an ocean and an envelope of air. If the lithosphere
were perfectly smooth and at rest, with the hydrosphere uniformly spread over
its surface, the former would have the form of the terrestrial spheroid, and the
latter would surround it to a depth of 1.7 miles. The surface of this hypothetical
spheroid Dr. Mill calls <em>mean sphere level</em>. Of course, in reality the
surface of the lithosphere is not perfectly smooth. Parts of it are greatly
depressed and parts much elevated, the latter forming the land of the earth.
The writer proceeds to calculate the position of mean sphere level, and in
the absence of accurate data he uses the careful estimates of Dr. John Murray,
which are as follows: Average depths of oceans = 2.36 miles; average
height of land = .426 miles; average thickness of hydrosphere surrounding
smoothed lithosphere = 1.7 mile; area of land = 55,000,000 square miles;
area of oceans = 141,700,000 square miles. Suppose a block of 55,000,000
of square miles area and 1.7 miles deep to be cut out of the smoothed lithosphere
and set down on the surface alongside the depression. No change
will take place in the surface of the hydrosphere. If the surface of the 141,700,000
square miles of lithosphere were reduced to uniformity, the whole
depressed area would lie .66 mile beneath mean sphere level, and the depth of
the ocean becomes 2.36 miles. To raise the land to its actual mean level
above the hydrosphere surface, a sufficient quantity of matter must be
removed from the depressed area and placed on the elevated block. Let <i>x</i>
= the thickness of the belt removed and <i>y</i> equal the thickness of the belt
when placed on the elevated block. Then <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> is the height of the land
above the actual hydrosphere level. From the data given the following equations
are easily obtained:</p>

<div class="p1 b1 center"><div class="ilb">
<p class="in0 mono">
      <i>x</i> + <i>y</i> - .426      =  0<br />
141.7 <i>x</i>     -   55 <i>y</i>    =  0<br />
      <i>x</i>     = .12 and <i>y</i> = .306 in miles.
</p>
</div></div>

<p>The average height of the land above mean sphere level is thus 1.7 +
.306 = 2.006 miles, and the average depth of the depressed portion beneath
mean sphere level is .66 + .12 = .78 mile.</p>

<p>Dr. Mill divides the earth into the three following divisions: (1) <i>Abysmal
area</i>, occupying all the depressions beneath the mean surface of the lithosphere,
occupying 50 per cent. of the earth’s surface; (2) <i>Transitional area</i>,
comprising all the regions above mean sphere level covered by the hydrosphere,
occupying 22 per cent. of the surface; (3) <i>Continental area</i>, all the
lithosphere that projects above the hydrosphere, or 28 per cent. of the earth’s
surface.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
